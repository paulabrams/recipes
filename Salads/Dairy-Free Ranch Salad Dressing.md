- 3-4 tbsp. dairy-free milk (see notes)
- 2 tsp. dried parsley
- 1 tsp. dried chives
- 1 tsp. dried dill
- ¾ tsp. garlic powder
- ¾ tsp. onion powder

## Notes

- In order to keep this dressing as clean and healthy as possible, I recommend Primal Kitchen avocado oil mayonnaise.
- Start with 3 tablespoons of milk. If you want your dressing thinner, add additional milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. 
- All ingredients are Paleo approved assuming you use Primal Kitchen  mayo and an almond milk based yogurt. 
- Best if chilled in the fridge for a couple of hours, but can be eaten right away. 
- Dressing should be stored in the fridge in an airtight container. It will stay fresh for 7 days.
