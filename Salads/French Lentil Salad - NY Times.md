# French Lentil Salad

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1½ cups dried lentils (preferably French green lentils)
- [ ] 5 thyme sprigs, plus 2 teaspoons thyme leaves
- [ ] 5 small rosemary sprigs
- [ ] 2 fresh bay leaves
- [ ] ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- [ ] 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- [ ] 2 teaspoons honey
- [ ] 1 large lemon, zested and juiced
- [ ] Salt and freshly cracked black pepper
- [ ] 2 medium shallots, trimmed, halved and sliced lengthwise (about 6 ounces)
- [ ] 2 to 3 small garlic cloves, minced
- [ ] 3 medium carrots, thinly sliced (about 8 ounces)
- [ ] 1 small head radicchio, halved, cored and thinly sliced (about 6 ounces)
- [ ] 1 large bunch parsley leaves and stems, finely chopped (about 4 ounces)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon roughly chopped dill
- [ ] 2 teaspoons chopped tarragon leaves

## Directions
1. Sort through lentils, removing any small pebbles or stones, then rinse lentils well. Using kitchen twine, tie the thyme sprigs, rosemary sprigs and bay leaves together in a small bundle to form a bouquet garni.
2. Add lentils and bouquet garni to a large pot and add enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil on high then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cover and simmer until lentils are tender, 12 to 20 minutes, depending on the type of your lentils. Discard the bouquet garni. Drain the lentils and rinse with cold water. Line a sheet pan with a towel and pour lentils out evenly onto the pan to dry and cool.
3. While the lentils cook, prepare the vinaigrette: In a large bowl, combine vinegar, olive oil, mustard, honey, thyme leaves, half the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper; whisk well. Add the shallots and garlic to the vinaigrette and let them marinate while the lentils cool.
4. Once the lentils are cool and dry, add them to the bowl with the vinaigrette. Add the carrots, radicchio, parsley, dill, tarragon, lemon zest, and remaining lemon juice. Toss well to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and additional olive oil if needed.
