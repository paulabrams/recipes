# Lentil Salad

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 cup lentils (green or Lentils de Puy/French lentils)
- [ ] 4 cups water
- [ ] 1 bay leaf
- [ ] 1 large cucumber, finely diced
- [ ] 1/2 red onion, finely diced
- [ ] 1 cup Medjool dates, finely diced
- [ ] 1 small bunch flat leaf parsley, chopped
- [ ] 1 recipe Lemon Vinaigrette (use half for this recipe)

## Directions

### 1. Cook the Lentils
1. In a medium saucepan, add the lentils, water, and bay leaf
2. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat to very low
3. Cover the pot and simmer for 16 to 20 minutes
4. The lentils should be soft but not at all mushy
5. Drain and chill in the fridge for a few minutes

### 2. Assemble the Salad
1. Add the diced cucumber, red onion, dates, and parsley to the chilled lentils
2. Drizzle the lemon vinaigrette on top
3. Toss everything together until well combined

## Tips
- Keep cucumber, onion, and dates in a uniform, very small dice for best results
- Green or French lentils work best as they hold their shape without getting mushy
- Can substitute dried raisins, prunes, cranberries, or cherries for the dates
- For meal prep, slightly undercook the lentils (reduce by 2 minutes) as they'll soften when sitting with the dressing

## Notes
- Serves 6 people
- Total time: 30 minutes (10 min prep, 20 min cook)
- Will stay good for 4-5 days in the fridge
- Perfect with baked salmon, Greek lemon chicken, or falafel
