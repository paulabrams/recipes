1. **Prep the slaw base**
   In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, carrots, apples, and green onions (if using).

   In a separate bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning.

3. **Add herbs**
   Stir in the rosemary, sage, oregano, parsley, and thyme. These give the slaw its earthy, aromatic backbone.
