### For the Bowls

## Directions

1. Toss the coriander seeds and cloves in a 6-quart pressure cooker. Press the sauté button on your Instant Pot and toast the spices for several minutes, shaking or stirring, until fragrant.
2. Add the ginger and onion and stir everything until aromatic, 45 to 60 seconds.
3. Pour in 4 cups of the water to stop the cooking process. Carefully place the chicken in the cooker, breast side up.
4. Add the apple, cilantro, salt, and remaining 3 cups water.
5. Press the Cancel/Keep Warm button, lock the lid in place, and make sure the valve on top is in the sealed position.
6. Press the Manual button and set the Instant Pot to cook under high pressure for 14 minutes.
7. When done, turn off the Instant Pot and let the pressure decrease naturally for 20 minutes.
8. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to avoid the hot steam.
9. Wait another 5 minutes before using tongs to transfer the chicken to a large bowl.
10. Add cold water to cover the chicken and soak for 10 minutes to cool and prevent drying. Pour off the water and set the chicken aside to cool.
11. Skim some fat from the broth, then strain it through a mesh strainer. You should end up with about 7 cups broth.
12. Season the broth with fish sauce, extra salt, and maple syrup to taste.
13. Shred the chicken into bite-size pieces, discarding skin and bones.
14. Divide the zucchini noodles among four soup bowls. Top with shredded chicken.
15. Bring the broth to a boil and ladle about 2 cups into each bowl.
16. Garnish with onion, green onion, fresh herbs, and other optional toppings. Serve immediately.
