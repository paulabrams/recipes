### Dutch Oven Pork Chops 'n' Onions

Pork chops are hard to do right.  I hear about people's tough pork chops all the time in "the biz", but these ones are done right.  The trick, you ask??  Slow cook the pork chops at a low temperature, and make sure they are covered!  They can be done in your slow cooker, but I really prefer to bake them in my dutch oven, since slow cookers can sometime cook for too long and get a little dried out.  These are flavorful, and aside from baking time, they only take about 10 minutes to throw together.

5-6 pork chops, 1" thick
2 small sweet onions, thinly sliced
2 tsp. black pepper
1-2 tsp. Seasoned Salt
2 tsp. Mrs. Dash (or chicken pork rub) salt-free seasoning
2 tsp. paprika
2 TBS. olive oil
4-6 slices hickory smoked bacon (raw)
Mix paprika, Mrs. Dash, pepper and season salt together.  Cover bottom of dutch oven with olive oil, and place slices of one onion in oil.  Place on stove top on high.  Place 5-6 pork chops (about 1 inch thick) on top of onion.  Sprinkle both sides of pork chops generously with paprika, pepper and Mrs. Dash (about half of spice mixture).  Sear both sides of meat until browned.  Remove from heat.  Top with slices of other onion, and  sprinkle with remaining spice mixture.
Place bacon slices over onions.  Bake in covered dutch oven at 300 degrees for 1 hour and 25 minutes
Remove from oven and make gravy with the drippings (optional).  Serve with sweet potato souffle (recipe coming soon) and seared green vegetables.
