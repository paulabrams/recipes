# Pork Poblano Stew

!\[\[evernote/_resources/Pork_Poblano_Stew_-\_THE_WRIGHT_RECIPES.resources/unknown_filename.2.jpeg\]\]

I have been cooking a ton lately, stocking my freezer with the overflow from my days in the kitchen. While I was rifling around in my freezer to make space for a new crop of frozen dinners, I came across a huge bag of country pork ribs that I had saved– and apparently since forgotten about– from an earlier project. I needed the space and had been considering a delicious pork stew, so thought I would make it happen. The resulting peppery pork stew was incredibly similar to one I remember from my trips to Santa Fe, which is exactly what I was going for. (I served up leftovers with a fried egg and tortillas for breakfast, just like they do at our favorite diner just outside the Plaza.)

> **Pork Poblano Stew**
>
> 6 poblano peppers
> 2 green bell peppers
> 3 lbs. country pork ribs, cut into 2-inch pieces
> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
> 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
> 1 chopped large onion
> 2 garlic cloves, chopped
> 1 tsp. ground cumin
> 1 qt. chicken broth
> 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes
> Sour cream and charred corn tortillas, for serving
>
> 1. Heat broiler with rack in highest position. Arrange poblano and green peppers on a broiler-proof baking sheet; broil until charred, turning peppers to blacken all sides, about 12 to 15 minutes total (removing peppers from pan as they become charred). Transfer peppers to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap; when cool enough to handle, remove skin and seeds and chop.

- Season pork generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high; cook pork 10 minutes per batch or until browned on all sides. Remove pork from pan; add onion to oil. Cook, stirring often, 10 to 12 minutes or until onion has softened. Stir in garlic and cumin; cook 1 minute or until fragrant.
- Stir in chicken broth, potatoes and reserved pork; season generously with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 1 hour or until pork is tender. Add reserved peppers; simmer 20 minutes more. Serve with sour cream and tortillas.
