# Braised cabbage with sausages

## Ingredients
- [ ] 80 ml (⅓ cup) extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves, finely minced
- [ ] 1 chili pepper, crushed
- [ ] 4 fresh Italian sausages
- [ ] 1 medium Savoy cabbage, about 1 kg / 2 lb, finely sliced
- [ ] 3 peeled tomatoes, diced
- [ ] Fine sea salt

## Directions
1. In a large pan over medium-low heat, heat the olive oil and add the minced garlic and the crushed chili pepper. Cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Remove the sausage casings and break them up into big crumbs, add them to the pan and cook them for a few minutes.
3. Now add the finely sliced cabbage and the diced tomatoes, season with salt and stir to combine them with the sausage.
4. Cover and cook for about 45 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. Should the dish dry out too much, add a few spoonfuls of warm water.
5. Adjust for salt towards the end of the cooking time when the cabbage is very soft, and serve.
