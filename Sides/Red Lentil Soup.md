# Red Lentil Soup

## Ingredients

- [ ] 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- [ ] 1 large onion, chopped
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves, minced
- [ ] 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- [ ] Salt and black pepper
- [ ] Pinch of chili powder or ground cayenne, plus more to taste
- [ ] 1 quart chicken or vegetable broth
- [ ] 2 cups water
- [ ] 1 cup red lentils
- [ ] 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
- [ ] Juice of ½ lemon, more to taste
- [ ] 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

## Directions

1. In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over high until hot and shimmering. Add onion and garlic, and sauté until golden, about 4 minutes.
2. Stir in tomato paste, cumin, ¼ teaspoon each salt and black pepper and the chili powder, and sauté for 2 minutes longer.
3. Add broth, 2 cups water, lentils and carrot. Bring to a simmer, then partly cover pot and turn heat to medium-low. Simmer until lentils are soft, about 30 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary.
4. Using an immersion or regular blender or a food processor, purée half the soup, then add it back to pot. The soup should be somewhat chunky.
5. Reheat soup if necessary, then stir in lemon juice and cilantro. Serve soup drizzled with good olive oil and dusted lightly with chili powder, if desired.

## Tips

- Red lentils cook faster than their green or black counterparts
- Puréeing half the soup creates a balance between chunky and pleasingly smooth
- A hit of lemon juice adds an up note that offsets the deep cumin and chile flavors
- Based on Turkish lentil soup, mercimek corbasi

## Notes
