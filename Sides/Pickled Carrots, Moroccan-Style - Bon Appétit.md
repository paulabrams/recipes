*From Bon Appétit*

These vibrant pickled carrots add a spicy, tangy crunch to any meal. The Moroccan-inspired spice blend with coriander and cumin makes them perfect as a condiment or side dish.

## Recipe Details

- **Makes**: 1 quart
- **Prep time**: 15 minutes
- **Chilling time**: At least 12 hours

## Ingredients

- 1 1/4 lbs baby or medium-size red, orange, yellow, and white carrots, peeled and trimmed
- Peel from 1 lemon, removed in strips with vegetable peeler
- 4 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
- 4 small dried hot red chiles (such as chiles de árbol), halved
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 tbsp coarse kosher salt
- 2 tsp coriander seeds, cracked
- 2 tsp cumin seeds, cracked

## Instructions

1. **Prepare carrots**: Leave baby carrots whole. For large carrots, cut lengthwise into halves, then cut each half lengthwise into halves or quarters. Spears should be no wider than 1/2 inch.

2. **Pack jar**: Pack carrots vertically into a 1-quart jar, cutting spears to fit as needed. Add lemon peel, garlic, and chiles, allowing some chile seeds to spill into jar (seeds from 1 chile add mild spiciness).

3. **Make brine**: Mix water, vinegar, sugar, salt, coriander, and cumin in a medium saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar and salt dissolve, then boil for 3 minutes.

4. **Pour and cool**: Pour hot brine over carrots, adding all spices to jar. Cool completely, then cover jar tightly.

5. **Chill**: Refrigerate for at least 12 hours before serving.

## Notes

- Can be made up to 1 week ahead - keep chilled
- The mix of carrot colors makes for a beautiful presentation
- Adjust chile seeds to taste - more seeds = more heat
- Perfect accompaniment to tagines, grilled meats, or sandwiches
