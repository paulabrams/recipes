## Ingredients

- [ ] ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- [ ] 1½ pounds small carrots, approximately 5 inches in length, scrubbed clean and tops trimmed
- [ ] 1 bay leaf (fresh, scored)
- [ ] 1 head garlic, cut in half
- [ ] 5 to 7 sprigs fresh thyme
- [ ] ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For the Blood-orange Vinaigrette

- [ ] 2 blood oranges, juiced
- [ ] 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- [ ] 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- [ ] ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ] ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

### For the Cumin Crème Fraîche

- [ ] 1 cup crème fraîche
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- [ ] 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- [ ] Pinch kosher salt
- [ ] 2-3 tablespoons water (to thin)

### For the Salad

- [ ] ½ small red onion, thinly sliced
- [ ] 1 tablespoon roughly chopped roasted almonds
- [ ] 2 blood oranges, cut into supremes
- [ ] 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley
- [ ] 1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon
- [ ] 1 tablespoon finely chopped chervil
- [ ] 1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
- [ ] Kosher salt or fleur de sel

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Toast the cumin for both the carrots and the crème fraîche in a small pan set over medium heat until it becomes aromatic. Remove from heat, and set aside.
2. Place carrots, bay leaf, split head of garlic, thyme and olive oil into a bowl, and mix them together. Sprinkle ½ teaspoon cumin over the carrots, and mix again.
3. Tip the carrot mixture onto a sheet pan, and spread evenly into one layer, then season with salt and pepper and place in oven. Roast until the carrots are soft and beginning to caramelize, 30 to 45 minutes.
4. Remove carrots from oven, discard aromatics and set aside to cool.
5. Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette. Combine blood-orange juice, vinegar, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl, and whisk to incorporate. Slowly add the olive oil while continuing to whisk, until the dressing is emulsified. Add the carrots to the bowl, and toss to combine.
6. Make the cumin crème fraîche. Combine the crème fraîche, lemon juice and remaining toasted cumin in a mixing bowl, and stir to combine. Thin the mixture slightly with a few tablespoons of water. Add a pinch of salt.
7. Assemble the salad on a large serving plate. Put the crème fraîche in the center of the plate, and using the back of a spoon, spread it evenly across the bottom. Arrange the carrots on top of the crème fraîche. Scatter the red onion, almonds and blood-orange supremes over the carrots. Sprinkle the herbs over everything, and finish with a light sprinkling of salt or fleur de sel.

## Tips

- Don't worry if you can't find all the herbs for the garnish - just one or two will bring pleasure
