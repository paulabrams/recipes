# Caramelized Brussels Sprouts With Lemon

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 pounds brussels sprouts, bottoms trimmed only very slightly
- [ ] 4 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] 1 lemon

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Working over a bowl, use a paring knife to shave off several thin layers from the bottom of each sprout, pulling off the darker outer leaves and letting the trim and leaves fall into the bowl, until you have just the tight, light-green core of each sprout. Set aside the bowl of leaves, then slice any very large cores in half. (The leaves can be separated from the cores 1 day ahead. Store them separately in lidded containers in the refrigerator.)
2. Combine the cores and 2 tablespoons oil on a rimmed baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Toss thoroughly to combine, arrange any cut pieces cut-sides down, then transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast, shaking the baking sheet once or twice, until the tip of a paring knife slides into the cores with just a little resistance, 30 to 35 minutes.
3. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and set aside, then increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the bowl of leaves and season lightly with salt and pepper, then toss thoroughly until all the leaves are coated, separating any that are stuck together. Scatter the leaves over the baking sheet, then return it to the oven and roast until the leaves are bright green and crispy in places and the cores are caramelized all over, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let cool slightly, then finely grate about half the lemon zest evenly over the sprouts. Just before serving, cut the lemon in half and squeeze half over the baking sheet. Taste the brussels sprouts and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Transfer to a dish and serve immediately.

## Tips
- Separating the dark green outer leaves from the lighter green cores allows you to roast them so they're both tender and crispy
- Prep them ahead of time for an easy side dish
- The leaves can be separated from the cores 1 day ahead - store them separately in lidded containers in the refrigerator
