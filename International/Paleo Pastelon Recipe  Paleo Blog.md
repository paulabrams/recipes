Back in late October, before Thanksgiving and the craziness that can be the Christmas Season, Hubs and our fellow CrossFitter, Junior F., came up with an idea to have a Paleo Pot Luck.

The plan hatched during the weekend we spent in Tampa while they participated in something muddy and scary called the Savage Race.  (No, I didn’t sign up because 1) I don’t like to get dirty and 2) they did some crazy stuff that involved fire and barbed wire.  I did, however, tag along.  I stayed clean and took some pictures.  And had lots of fun staying clean.)  Have I mentioned how much I love our CrossFit Family?

The rules for the Pot Luck were easy.  The food had to be Paleo and had to be homemade.  It was really pretty awesome because not one person brought grocery store cupcakes or a cheese tray.  Many of us shared our recipes and I  hope to feature them and their chefs here on the blog  because we really made some outstanding dishes.

First up is Jose’s (aka HispanikPanic) version of Pastelon which is a Puerto Rican sort of lasagna made with sweet plantains instead of pasta.  I made this on Sunday…it took a while but it was well worth the time.

Some notes on my first experience with this dish…

You can certainly use any regular meat sauce recipe that you like…this one is great and was super easy though.

Jose’s recipe called for 1 cup each of chopped red bell pepper and chopped green bell pepper sautéed with the onion.  Hubs and I are trying to avoid most night shades, so I roasted some carrots as a substitute.  I know tomatoes are night shades too, but I can’t think of a substitute for tomato paste.

Ripe plantains are generally pretty darned black. So it is best to buy them a few days ahead so they will be ready when you are.

# Ingredients:

- 6 ripe plantains

- 8 eggs

- 1 sweet onion, chopped

- 6-8 carrots, peeled and cut into rounds

- 3-4 garlic cloves, minced

- 2 pounds grass-fed ground beef

- 1 six ounce can tomato paste

- 1/2 cup chicken stock

- 1/2 cup dry wine (red or white)

- 4-6 tablespoons coconut oil (maybe more)

- salt/pepper to taste

# Directions:

1. Your oven will need to be heated to 350 degrees.

- Heat 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in your sauté pan and add the onions.
- In the meantime, you can roast the carrots at 400 degrees with a little coconut oil for about the same amount of time.  (You will need to stir the carrots and onions every ten minutes or so.  Don’t worry too much about them, but don’t go out for a run either…)  You can just sauté them both until they are all soft; it’s a little quicker.
- While the onions and carrots are cooking, peel your plantains.  You will need to slice them lengthwise into long strips, about a half inch thick which is usually 4 slices per plantain.  Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in your skillet to about medium low temperature.  Add the plantain strips and cook for 3-4 minutes per side; they will need to be lightly browned and soft.   Drain them on paper towels and sprinkle with a little salt while they are still hot.
- Beat four of the eggs with a little salt and pepper.  Grease the bottom of your glass casserole dish with some coconut oil and pour in the eggs.  Bake in your oven for 6-7 minutes until they are set, but not done. Put the dish aside and finish the meat sauce.
- Stir  the carrots  into the onion if you didn’t cook them together; add the minced garlic.  When you smell the garlic, it’s ready.  Add the ground beef and cook it with the veggies, until it has lost its red, raw color. Stir in the tomato paste, then add the chicken stock and wine.  Let this simmer for about 20 minutes.  Taste your sauce when it’s done and season with salt and pepper to your liking.  Place a layer of cooked plantain slices on top of the partially cooked egg in your casserole dish.  Spoon all of the meat sauce over the plantains.  Layer the rest of the plantains over the meat sauce.
- Beat the remaining four eggs with a little more salt and pepper and pour over the casserole.  Let the eggs soak in for a few minutes and then bake your Pastelon in the oven for 40-45 minutes.  Let it rest for five minutes before serving.  Enjoy ‘cos this is yummy…

pumpkin works well as tomato paste/sauce.

  This sounds good except for the extremely high sugar content of the plantains for a lot of people. The calorie count is over 1300 for them alone and half of that is sugar with only . Even if you divide the recipe into 6 portions, that is still a whopping 55% of the calories in the plantains being pure sugar. That’s why I use zucchini to replace the noodles in my copycat lasagna preparations. Not only are they high in potassium to go along with the high potassium of the tomato paste, they don’t add a lot of sugar. The only item I can think of as a potential sub for the tomato paste is pumpkin puree. I know, not the same color but it would add thickening to the meat sauce similar to the paste. And it adds more fiber and less sugar to the final dish. I have found that pumpkin puree doesn’t add a lot of distinctive flavor but it does give a bit of sweetness without a lot of sugar. Hard to come up with a good sub for the paste as you’ve already discovered. I’m going to try this as another alternative to noodles as well with the pumpkin and see how that looks meat sauce wise. It may be a total bust. Good recipe suggestion though. Thanks.
