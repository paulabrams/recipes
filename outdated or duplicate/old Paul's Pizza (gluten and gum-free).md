This is an *excellent* recipe to use if you also make almond milk. Not only does this allow you to make use of the chaff that you normally might throw away, but it reduces the strength of the almond flavor.

Arrange your oven racks for pizzas with a baking stone (alternatively a cast-iron griddle or baking sheet) and preheat the oven to 450F.

Put the following into a blender:

- 3 eggs

- 4 tbsp olive oil

- 2 tbsp water

- 1/2 tbsp salt

- 1 tsp italian herbs or oregano

- 1/2 TSP baking soda

Add the following ingredients one at a time **in order,** blending for 1/2 minute on slow (e.g. “stir”) after each time you add something:

- 1 cup almond flour  (this is what you have left over after you make almond milk!)

- 1/2 cup rice flour

- 1/2 cup potato flour or starch

- (last!!) 1/2 cup tapioca flour

The consistency should be like pancake batter. If not then add a small amount of water and blend.

Put a piece of parchment onto a pizza peel, then pour some of the batter on the paper and use a spatula to spread it into the shape of a pizza crust. (This sounds weird, but is actually far easier than making a gluten-based pizza crust!)

Put the parchment into the oven on the baking stone and bake for 10-15 minutes, until it gets crispy in the middle, but don’t let it get golden brown. It should look like a giant cracker!

Take the pizza out and coat the top with olive oil, using a brush to spread it all over. Then add some sauce and other toppings.

Put the pizza back into the oven without the paper and bake for another 5-10 minutes, until the toppings look bubbly, caramelized, golden brown and yummy.

Remove from oven, cut into slices, and enjoy!

**Notes:**

- You can reuse the same parchment many times.

- I used a cast iron griddle to make two smaller pizzas for the boys to top.

- Using a pizza peel helps a lot.

- I baked some leeks on top of one pizza.

- You can bake the parchment paper to dry it and then use it to wrap up leftover slices for lunch.
