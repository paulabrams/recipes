# 3-2-1 Ribs

## Ingredients
- [ ] Spare ribs (or baby back ribs)
- [ ] Yellow mustard (thin layer for rub adherence)
- [ ] Rib rub seasoning
- [ ] Apple juice (for spraying, about 1/4 cup per rack)
- [ ] Heavy duty foil
- [ ] Optional: barbecue sauce, jelly, or honey for glazing

## Directions
1. Remove membrane from ribs and rub down with thin layer of mustard
2. Apply rib rub seasoning evenly
3. Preheat smoker to 225°F
4. **Step 1 (3 hours):** Place ribs meat-side up on smoker grate. Maintain thin blue smoke. Optional: spray with apple juice every hour. Cook until meat pulls back 1/4 inch from bone (about 3 hours)
5. **Step 2 (2 hours):** Remove ribs and wrap each rack in heavy duty foil with 1/4 cup apple juice. Return to smoker and maintain 225°F for 2 hours
6. **Step 3 (1 hour):** Remove foil and place ribs back on grate. This firms up the outside crust. Optional: glaze with sauce if desired. Cook for 1 hour
7. Remove ribs and let rest on counter for 20 minutes before slicing
8. Slice ribs bone-side up so you can see what you're doing

## Tips
- Use spare ribs for more flavor due to higher fat content
- Never pre-boil ribs - this removes flavor
- For baby back ribs, use 2-2-1 method instead of 3-2-1
- Spraying helps keep ribs moist without disturbing the rub
- Maintain "thin blue smoke" - barely visible smoke output

## Notes
- Total cooking time: 6 hours plus 20 minutes rest
- Temperature: 225°F throughout
- Method works for both spare ribs and baby back ribs
- Resting allows juices to redistribute throughout the meat
