# One Bowl Gluten Free Banana Bread

!\[\[One-Bowl-Gluten-Free-Banana-Bread-So-moist-hearty-.jpg\]\]

Three bananas. One Bowl. Zero gluten. Let’s do this.

. It’s one of my favorites of all time. Yes, all time. But I couldn’t help but strip it down to the absolute essentials and take it back to classic banana bread land.

Friends, behold: One Bowl Gluten Free Banana Bread.

!\[\[Gluten-Free-Banana-Bread-One-bowl-wholesome-ingred.jpg\]\]!\[\[Gluten-Free-Banana-Bread-Batter.jpg\]\]

The ingredients for this scrumptious, hearty bread begin with three overripe bananas. Then come essentials you likely already have on hand, such as eggs (or chia/flax eggs), vanilla and coconut oil. To sweeten things up a bit more I relied on a mix of honey, cane and brown sugar for a variance of flavor and texture.

Then comes the gluten free goodness: a mix of gluten free oats, almond meal and my favorite gluten free flour blend (which can be subbed out with just about any gluten free blend).

This recipe is forgiving in that the type of GF blend you use doesn’t really matter as much since there’s two other dry ingredient components evening things out. And of course, if you’re not gluten free just sub whole wheat pastry or all purpose for the blend.

45 minutes to 1 hour in the oven and this baby is ready for the taking.

!\[\[Gluten-Free-Banana-Bread-1-Bowl-simple-ingredients.jpg\]\]

I could hardly wait to slice in, but patience is key here. You need to wait a good hour before cutting into this baby, else it will crumble and fall apart. That’s what you don’t want.

!\[\[One-Bowl-Gluten-Free-Banana-Bread-Recipe-glutenfre.jpg\]\]

This is what you do want. A hearty loaf that holds its shape and converts even the most suspicious of eaters into gluten free banana bread lovers. Hubba hubba.

!\[\[1-Bowl-Gluten-Free-Banana-Bread-Whole-grain-goodne.jpg\]\]

This bread is:

Hearty
Perfectly moist
Loaded with banana flavor
Just sweet enough
Spotted with oats and almond meal
Slightly nutty
Incredibly satisfying
Altogether dreamy

Trust me, you’re gonna love this bread. Enjoy!

Author: Minimalist Baker
Recipe type: Breakfast
Cuisine: Vegan, Gluten Free Optional
Serves: 10

Ingredients

- normal3 medium ripe bananas (~1.5 cups or 337 g)

- normal1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

- normal1 egg (or sub 1 chia or flax egg – see notes)

- normal3 Tbsp (45 ml) grape seed or coconut oil, melted

- normal1/4 cup (50 g) organic cane sugar

- normal1/4 cup packed (55 g) organic brown sugar

- normal2-3 Tbsp (63-84 g) honey, depending on ripeness of bananas (or sub maple syrup)

- normal3.5 tsp baking powder

- normal3/4 tsp sea salt

- normal1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

- normal3/4 cup (180 ml) unsweetened almond or dairy milk

- normal1 1/4 cup (137 g) almond meal

- normal1 1/4 cup (200 g) gluten free flour blend

- normal1 1/4 cup (112 g) gluten free oats

Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a loaf pan with parchment paper or spray with nonstick spray.

- Mash banana in a large bowl. Add all ingredients through almond milk and whisk vigorously to combine. Last add almond meal, gluten free flour blend and oats and stir.
- Bake for 1 hour – 1 hour 15 minutes. When ready, it should feel firm and be crackly and golden brown on top.
- Let cool completely before cutting or it will be too tender to hold form.
- Serve with butter and honey or as is. Store leftovers in a covered container for up to a few days. Slice and freeze for longer term storage.

Notes \***GOOD NEWS!** Several people have tried this recipe vegan-ized by swapping the egg for 1 chia or flax egg and have reported that it works well! To do so, just combine 1 Tbsp chia seed or flaxseed meal with 2.5 Tbsp water, mix and let set for 5 minutes to activate. Then add to the recipe when I note to add the egg. * Adapted from my GF Banana Butternut Squash Bread, originally adapted from TakeAMegabite.

When the top looks “done” (lightly browned), place a piece of foil over the top of the bread. You don’t need to secure it. This will help the inside cook while keeping the top from darkening too much.

the coconut flour was the issue as it is extremely absorbent. You either had to decrees the amount of coconut flour or increase the amount of liquid. Coconut flour is tricky to work with but oh so good! :)

With coconut flour you always need to add extra eggs. It’s just drier. You may have to play with your egg/coconut flour ratios to get a good batter.

I try not to swear off anything in my diet, because then that’s the very thing I will inevitably begin to want. As I’ve done that, I’ve found I naturally stop craving the foods that aren’t best for me. I hope that’s the case for you, too! That would be amazeballs. ;D Thanks again for saying hi!

	Probably well, though it will likely affect the texture since I mixed wet and dry for sweeteners. If it appears too dry, just add a little more liquid. Hope that helps, Zoe!

I made this last night with a flax/chia seed (ground) with water to replace the egg and it worked perfectly. My husband couldn’t wait to cut into it so after only 15 min of resting he cut off a slice – beautifully intact and slathered it with earthbound margarine. I am sure the loaf will only last till this afternoon. Thank you for the great recipe!

	That would work! I think oat flour and oats measure about the same. Just add a little less oat flour at first, and then add enough until it looks thick enough. Hope that helps! But if it’s any help, you really can’t decipher the oats once they’re baked.

I subbed in whole wheat pastry flour for the gluten free flour blend, used one egg and coconut oil. I baked it for one hour. The bread is a bit more crumbly than other banana breads I am use to, but after sitting out for one day became more moist. The almonds in this bread lend a fantastic flavor and made a nice, filling and quick breakfast paired with fruit.

	Hi Dana,

	The bread came out fabulous! I added a splash of dark rum in addition to chopped almonds, cacao nibs and hemp hearts, and went vegan with flax ‘egg’….I also coarsely ground 1/2 of the oats

	I was hoping maybe some new commercial gf mix had caught your eye, but hand blending seems worth it overall

Perfect!!! I was just searching for a gluten free banana bread recipe, so far since going gf I haven’t made my own recipe (lazy) and haven’t liked any I’ve tried so far.
Making this NOW.
Oh and the coconut oil, even better since I was looking to make it dairy free.

I had this bookmarked to make for our families beach trip and I did the trial run today and OMG! It was YUM! Soooo cannot tell this is gluten free! I subbed out 1/8 cup Truvia baking blend instead of the cane sugar, left out the honey, and subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil. The texture is PERFECT, however it is a bit, not exciting. I’m going to try out the additions others have recommended and sub out coconut cream for the milk and coconut sugar for the brown sugar. And add walnuts (my mother doesn’t consider it banana bread without walnuts) and nutmeg. I think I am even going to do the flax seed instead of egg and make it gluten free, egg free, dairy free, and delicious!
Thank you for this! GF bread is often SO wrong in texture that it’s great to get one that isn’t!

I made this Banana “nut” bread today, for a ladies group that meets at my home. I am gluten free but they are not, so I was hoping it wasn’t too “odd” tasting to them. It came out wonderful! I added 1 cup of walnuts; I was worried it may be crumbly but it sliced just like or better than my old wheat Banana Bread recipe. I was so pleasantly surprised! I used 1/4 C. Coconut sugar in place of white sugar and followed the recipe except I used real butter and milk, so it wasn’t vegan. Very good and fairly “low sugar””. I will check out more of your recipes. Thanks!

My 18 year old niece has recently been diagnosed with several allergies and food intolerances, including dairy and gluten. She has really had a hard time finding recipes for favorite foods she can no longer eat, which includes banana bread. I was determined, so I searched and found your blog. I made this for her while I was visiting yesterday, but she did have a chance to sample the bread before I flew home today. This is the text I had from her when my plane landed: “Oh my goodness. This banana bread is delicious!!!!!!! The bread is so so so so so so so so so so so so so good.” Enough said! Thank you!! I can’t wait to try other things from your blog and send them to her!

Dana – I want to thank you! I was an avid baker as a child (made my first sheet of baklava at 10 years old!) and loved spending time whipping up decadent treats. As I got older though, and had a child – the thought of feeding my daughter sweet desserts or breakfast items made with white flour, sugar and butter just didn’t sit well with me. So I gave of my love for baking. I did have a brief flirtation with other ‘healthy baking’ cookbooks but found the ingredient lists and complicated (not to mention expensive) recipes to be not worth the trouble. Then, last week, when looking for a healthy, simple banana bread recipe (My husband is Gluten-Free so it’s been trying to make everyone happy around here!) I stumbled upon your lovely site! After having great success with this fantastic recipe – I HAD to try a batch of the Peanut Butter Cups – also a huge success! We used the leftover peanut butter/coconut cream as a ‘butter’ for this bread btw. I am very much looking forward to trolling through your amazing recipes and beautiful site – Congrats and thank you for doing us all such a great service!

I just baked this and it turned out great, with a rather dense moist texture that I really like. I like the variety of flavours here, this is different from banana bread recipes that just keep it really simple. I didn’t have coconut oil so I used about a quarter cup or so of butter, and I used only brown sugar. I added chocolate chips too – to encourage my ten year old daughter to give a gluten-free banana bread a try! I think she’ll like it. Next time I’m going to try with less sugar or maybe substitute just honey – this turned out quite sweet (for my taste – but I still love it) and I’m interested in trying it with a bit less of the sweet ingredients. I will definitely try some of your other recipes. Thanks!

	Hi there!

	If I were you I’d use corn starch instead of the rice starch because starches are more absorbent than almond flour. If you used all almond flour it might turn out a bit mushy? Coconut flour is ULTRA absorbent in my experience so it might affect the texture, but it might not! I think this recipe is pretty flexible :o)

Another review…..I stumbled across your blog looking for a gluten free banana bread. Although I have already made my stand-by banana bread recipe, adapting it for gluten free, I wanted to try something new.

Well, this one is a keeper! I used organic eggs and milk (we’re not vegan) and coconut oil…my own gluten free blend (from another blog, sorry) but otherwise, everything else was the same as the recipe calls for.

I baked it in a stoneware bread pan for 1 hour 10 minutes and let rest for 30 minutes in the pan, then 1 hour on a wire rack before cutting into it. This is really a full-flavored dense-but-not-heavy banana bread. It will now replace my old recipe which had a lot of oil and sugar in it…this one is so much healthier, and gluten free besides.

Thanks!!

I didn’t have all of the flour to make your flour combination, and I had no almond meal so I just added more oats, but my flour amount looked Way too much compared to my liquids.. And the loaf is very very clunky and a little hard. definitely think I did something wrong! How much flour is in your combination in total? I only used brown rice flour and tapioca! Will try round 2 tomorrow… Thank you :) x

This was great! I’m not GF but love to mix it up now and then! The true test will be when hubby gets home to try! Only thing I changed was using my own GF flour mix (Robin Hood) and used a mix of almonds and pecans for the meal. Great results! Only thing I would do differently is add something like chocolate chips, berries, or a crumble on top (maybe melted vegan butter and coconut) just for an extra oomph!

It turned out just as Rita commented in August; dry, bitter, awful. I should have known from the inconsistencies. I wish I read these comments first. It should probably be just 1 teaspoon, like many other recipes. Thanks for trying to get that cleared up. Too bad they stopped checking. Oh well.

I made this using flax eggs for our vegan houseguests over the weekend and it turned out great! it came together and baked up beautifully. I think next time I’ll wait until my bananas are super ripe and use a touch more oil, trying coconut instead of grape seed. I loved what the whole oats did for the consistency of the bread; it felt really wholesome and perfect for breakfast.

thanks for a solid recipe! I made three other vegan + gluten free loaves from different sources before this one and they all flopped horribly, so I’m super happy to have found something reliable and delicious. cheers!

I followed the recipe except for the gluten free flour blend in the recipe. Instead of buying 4 different flours required for this blend, I purchased Trader Joe’s Gluten Free Flour that had the same flour ingredients in the same sequence of ingredients on the ingredient list (due to the sequence I thought it might be similar). I did this because I didn’t want to spend $30.00 just for these 4 types of flour. I used Qty. 2 8 X 4 X 2 1/2 inch Godaddio anodized aluminum pans (sold on the internet). I did not change any other ingredients. This was baked for 1 hour in the oven. The result was 2 heavy bricks of costly ingredients. The bread did not improve by adding butter.

I went gluten-free eleven months ago and my health has improved significantly – especially clarity of thinking. I have purchased 8 gluten-free cook books and tried many of the recipes in these cook books. I have also tried recipes that use gluten-free flour blends from internet web sites. My experience has been that anything that is a bread, pastry, pizza crust, or dessert that uses gluten free flour or almond flour has been an extreme disappointment and a waste of the money spent on the ingredients. There are many foods that do not contain gluten and that is where I make my food budget investment now – by buying these foods and buying organic where possible. There is absolutely nothing that will match a good wheat pizza crust or real slice of artisan bread. I will cheat about every other week and have a good slice of real bread. The result is a red rash on the forehead and brain fog for several days. It really isn’t worth it. I have done a lot of research on the topics of gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, gmos and glyphosate (main ingredient in Roundup that is sprayed on wheat just before harvesting the wheat to increase grain kernal size). If you are gluten sensitive, include glyphosate in your research. Glyphosate/Roundup is used extensively on many crops that are not gmo crops or modern wheat. I find that even when I stay away from GMO ingredients and all wheat that I still frequently get the red rash. I believe this is possibly due to being poisoned by glyphosate. I spend at least 90 minutes a day shopping for food that is not contaminated, investigating labeling on products and meal preparation. I am 70 years old and this problem with our food supply did not exist 20 years ago. Do your research and share what you find with other people. Another thing I discovered by going gluten-free was that my blood pressure dropped 30-35 points on the systolic reading. This was after 10 months of no gluten.

Thank you to the author of this web site. I was not able to match the great picture that you have of the banana bread. I will try the recipe again using the size of bread pan that you used. Can you let us know what the measurement size is of the pan that you used?

I love love all of your recipes, I made this banana bread and loved it as well. The only thing, my bread baked in about 35 mins tops, if I’d have left it in the over for 45 minutes, it’d be fried. I’m not sure what I did differently, but I’m glad I took it out when I did! My BF said it was the “best banana bread he’s ever had” :)

3.5 tsp baking powder? is that 3 1/2 tsp? or a typo and 3/4 tsp? I just want to make sure…

btw, I made this recipe with 3 1/2 tsp a few weeks ago, and then again last night with 3/4 tsp because I was thinking 3.5 tsp was wrong… either way, it has come out GREAT!! Last night, I put chopped walnuts on top. Can’t wait to bite in! thank for posting!!

Hi, a word of warning to formally diagnosed gluten-intolerant people aka coeliacs. While oats are technically gluten free, the protein in oats is so similar to gluten that most coeliacs will have a problem with it and therefore labelling laws at least in aus & nz do not classify oats as gf.

As a coeliac myself, i will be replacing the oats with quinoa flakes so i dont get sick.

but thankyou for your recipe nonetheless.

I LOVED this recipe!

I am a Master Fitness Trainer/nutritionist with an occasional uncontrollable sweet tooth and a gluten allergy. Oh the irony HAHA…I eat extremely clean but I’m willing to put the effort in the kitchen to make something sweet and delicious that’s healthy as well. Don’t mess with my post-work out treats, man! I am always looking for ways to sneak extra protein into said treats for added nutritional density (; With that said, I added a scoop of Gold Standard 100% Whey protein in Vanilla flavor to the batter, and subbed the almond meal for a little extra GF flour blend and GF oats (Almonds and I don’t get along either lol), baked for ONLY thirty min and the result was, um AMAZEBALLS!

Cheers,
D

PS My toddler has already asked me 3 times to have more bread!

This is wunderbar and sooo easy!! I received a kilo of very ripe bananas today and after arriving home after work, I wanted to make banana bread but it had to be vegan, easy and fast. Although I didn’t have every ingredient on your list, I could easily substitute them. I used a flax seed “egg” and slightly reduced the honey and sugar too. The main thing that caught my eye on this recipe was the “one bowl, less than 30 minutes”…I used my food processor and it was in the oven after 15 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe, inspiration and keeping it simple.

I’ve made scones that came out like salty brownies, cupcakes with a quiche-like consistency, and bread that never baked inside after 2 hours in the oven. Gluten free baking is tricky. But this worked! My bread rose, and cooked, and tasted like. . . BREAD. and it was GOOD. It was, in fact, DELICIOUS. Did I mention it actually turned into bread? This is a first. Huzzah. I substituted corn starch for potato starch in the GF blend and used just a little bit of light brown and dark brown sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I made this today and it tastes great. We can’t get GF oats in Australia (and oats do contain avenin anyway which is a form of gluten)….lucky I can handle oats though so it was all good. I used dates in place of the sugar (equal quantity) and flax egg and rice malt syrup. I also added some walnuts in the mix and some sliced banana on the top. I doubled the recipe and it made 2 large loaf tins and a small round tin. Can’t stop eating the stuff – yum!!!

I was so excited about this recipe as I usually just stick to modifying traditional recipes with all my healthy subs which never really works all that great. I had recently experimented with coconut and almond flours for the first time and so was excited to use what I had left of those as well.

My mods:

Brown sugar and maple syrup only
I used an oat blend that had bran and some other blends in it
Coconut and almond flours

Unfortunately I didn’t read all of these comments ahead of time or I would have steered clear of the coconut flour? I had no idea it was so sponges since the last time I used it the recipe called for it and had been tested for it I guess. So I made some quick final adjustments adding more almond milk oil and eggs in the hopes of saving the recipe. The remained very dense and didn’t rise at all. They are crumbly and dense but they seem like they’ll taste ok. I’ll happily try the recipe again though considering all the heavenly reviews.

I made this recipe into the most amazing banana muffins today in the dining hall kitchen where I work! I made them vegan with flax eggs, skipped the honey, split the “GF flour mix” in half and used half additional almond flour and half oat flour, used 1/2 coconut sugar and 1/2 raw cane sugar, and they taste amazing!! I also whisked together my coconut milk with a couple squeezes of lime juice before adding it to the rest of the ingredients–that reacts well with the baking powder and makes nice round tops! They are incredible, and I can’t wait to debut them tomorrow! Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe! :)

	Hi… I started making this recipe and realized I was missing ingredients so I substituted things. Although it came out quite dense… flavor and texture is good. Wondering what of my substituted items caused it to be so heavy. I used coconut sugar instead of cane. Used an extra 1/4 c oats and an extra cup of buckwheat flour. I had chocolate almond milk so I used that instead… :P
	Like i said it came out good but dense… one slice and ur full. Let me know what u believe may have made it so dense.

Wow – this was super easy and extremely yummy. I only had two ripe bananas so I used a third not as ripe one and the full amount of honey. I used Bobs 1 to 1 flour. Added walnuts and cacao. My new go-to banana bread recipe – thank you! ( I really give it 5 stars but my browser won’t let me highlight the last one)

This. Was. Phenomenal. Unbelievable. I usually don’t have to hide by baked goods from my gluten- eating family(they don’t like the taste) but this time I’m not taking any chances….thank you!!

this is the second batch I have made and the second to go in the trash..Turns out crusty on top and uncooked in the middle…I have left in way more than an hour-hoping it would cook—all to no avail. I was using Bob Mills Gluten free flour blend-could that be the problem—help–a any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

Hi another great recipe Minimalist Baker! ) I made only a few tweaks due to what I had on hand and it came out so delicious! In the world of gluten free vegan cooking each successful recipe is a celebration because it’s like a chemistry experiment! :) I followed recipe, except used 1 cup of buckwheat flour 1/4 tapioca for gluten free blend, and I blended the oats into flour. I also used 1/2-3/4 brown sugar and couple tablespoons of maple syrup. Added chopped walnuts too, yum! This is a keeper!

Delish! Hearty thick slices topped with butter and served with a side of fruit salad you can’t go wrong! I added chopped pumpkin seeds on top before cooking- I’ve always loved an extra crunch on top! Mother loved it ~~thumbs way up! :D

Just tried this recipe and it is AMAZING!! The best gluten free banana bread that I have ever had! It doesn’t even taste gluten free. I added chopped walnuts to our bread. I also wanted to add some golden flax seed meal to our loaf, so I substituted a 1/4 cup of the almond meal for the flax seed meal and I omitted the cinnamon. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I also thought the recipe called for a lot of baking powder (which yields a salty taste), and ended up using 3 with two capfuls of cider vinegar, 1/4 cup shredded coconut and an extra egg to avoid crumbliness.
I was looking for a recipe that didn’t have as much sugar, so I used 1/2 cup of coconut sugar and 3 tbsp of agave syrup and 1/4 cup concentrated organic pineapple juice.
I didn’t have gluten free flour so I used 1/4 c flax flour, 1/2 cup of coconut flour and 2 cups of almond flour. (which is very absorbing) and 2 tablespoons chia seed, so I added a 1/4 cup more almond milk to compensate for absorbency.
While adding the dry ingredients, the batter was rising!
Baked at 350 for 1 hour, still crumbly but tastes moist and delicious!!!

Just made this recipe and my mixture was so dry! More like actual bread dough than batter. I added a ton of extra almond milk but there just seemed to be too much of the dry ingredients.
I used a gluten free flour mix (no coconut flour) from the supermarket and also extra because I didn’t have almond meal.
Don’t know what I did wrong :(

I just made this recipe last night. It was my first totally from scratch gluten free baking attempt. I thought surely it would turn out awful since my boyfriend is allergic to nuts and I got to the last steps when I realized almond meal was part of the recipe. But, I just improvised and subbed equal parts of GF flour blend and more oats. It was SO hard to fall asleep with how yummy the house smelled after pulling it out of the oven to cool. I didn’t cut into the loaf until this morning. I reheated my slice in the microwave and IT. WAS. HEAVEN!

Hi Minimalist Baker! I had some squishy bananas to use and your recipe popped up. I don’t have a specific affliction, but I feel better when I eat gluten free and dairy free. In the past when I have tried to bake gluten free, the recipe has been complicated and the results disappointing. Not this time! My husband and I have been really enjoying the yummy banana bread. I’ll be coming back to your blog to look for more inspiration!

So…. I am making this but used Stevia insted of Sugar (I used slightly less than the recipe called for) and Coconut Flour for the GF flour blend. Not sure it will set up the same way but I am willing to try it. It smells absolutely wonderful. I have 10 more minutes to go to try it out. I will let you know if it turns out all right using the CF instead of GF blend. I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and used coconut milk in place of almond/dairy milk. We shall see….. I am looking forward to trying more of your recipes. I have do low sugar as well but that is usually pretty to substitute in most recipes. Glad I found your blog.

	it’s important to keep in mind that cholesterol in the diet doesn’t necessarily raise cholesterol in the blood… Which inevitably causes all those ” so called ” ailments in the body.

	The liver actually produces large amounts of cholesterol every single day. When we eat more eggs, the liver just produces less cholesterol instead, so it evens out.

	As a professional athlete and pescatarian eggs are a huge source of needed cholesterol and protein for me as I train.

	It’s an interesting nutritional dynamic between eggs and the myth that it raises cholesterol :-)

I made changes to the recipe, I didn’t have almond meal or the gluten-free flour (those are expensive in my neck of the woods to be honest) so I used oats, wholewheat flour and flaxseed meal. I didn’t have enough banana so I added some cooked pumpkin , I increased the sugar a little and added some raisins. I love making everything in muffin form , so that’s what I did and they were uber delicious.

My boyfriend has tons of food he can not eat, and this recipe was perfect!! Bananas are a special treat in our house so he loved it. I used coconut milk and for the GF flour blend I actually sub. vegan pumpkin protein powder for the white rice flour. I also added blueberries for some extra yummy-ness. Thank you so much for such a great recipe. I look forward to trying so many more.

Im not a person to ever give reviews, but this banana bread was amazing! I didn’t add the sugar listed on the recipe, instead I used 1/4 cup coconut sugar in total. Still sweet enough for my liking :)

Please be aware that oats are generally NOT safe as a gluten free good unless they are from a dedicated gluten free facility and specifically labeled ‘gluten free’. There is so much cross contamination in factories and oats are so prone to have flour stick on it which is why it’s not considered gluten free. Please be aware of these issues when claiming something is gluten free because it can really make people sick.

I have been on the search for the perfect GF banana bread for a while now and decided to try this recipe today for the first time. The loaf was quite bland and I could taste the baking powder which is one of my pet hates! It could be because I used coconut sugar as that is what I had on hand, although I wouldn’t have expected it to make much of a difference. I have used other GF banana bread recipes in the past which have a better taste and consistency, it may be because they use more banana (4 instead of 3) and more eggs. I guess I will be continuing the search!

Great recipe. I actually forgot to add the egg, but it still tastes great without it!

I also used 1/2 cup stevia crystals instead of the sugar, spelt flour and fresh almond milk and it worked perfectly.

Thanks – this will be a great new addition to my weekly baking list. The fact that I can make it dairy-free too is a bonus!

	The pumpkin bread was really good. I substituted a can of organic pumpkin for the bananas, added a tsp of bourbon and a splash of orange flavouring (just ’cause I felt like it), and used maple syrup instead of the honey, doubled the cinnamon to a nicely rounded tsp, and added 3/4 tsp nutmeg and ginger, and a couple dashes of ground cloves. I added a big handful of craisins and tablespoon of flax, and let them absorb all the extra liquidy goodness for a few minutes until adding the dry ingredients. The pecan meal I used instead of almond gave the bread such a great nutty flavour. Your original recipe is so wonderful, and it’s such a fantastic springboard for culinary creativity!

Made this today and the recipe is going into the “keeper” file. Love the many nutrient-rich ingredients, and I like that there’s a little almond flour to give it a boost of protein, without being too much.

I loved making this and my coworkers loved eating it even more! I didn’t have any brown packed sugar or baking powder/soda on hand so I used sweetened applesauce and a deeper pan – just in case it didn’t rise! I generally don’t even like banana nut bread, but I just added some almonds to the batter and this ended up being a real treat. Thanks!

Hi there, I made this recipe and it was good but I was actually looking for a recipe that I swear I got from your website and now I can’t find it… It was something like 7 ingredient chocolate chip banana bread. Do you have any recipes similar to that? I had it written down and made it for my kids multiple times last year, but unfortunately can not locate the recipe. Am I mistaken?

	Follow-up to my own mistake…I JUST realized that when you said ‘gluten free flour blend’ that you actually have a recipe for that! I had just assumed that any gluten free flour was fine. I will definitely need to try this recipe again with your flour blend, as my bread did not turn out well using coconut flour, gluten free oats and almond meal. Bummed I don’t get to eat the banana bread today but excited to try it again in the future.

Like the sound of this recipe. Read thru the positive reviews. Excited. Made. But Dang… split this between two loaf pans and rotated at 20 minutes to speed the baking and avoid the “raw middle” problem reported above. 50 minutes. Burned on the outside and raw on the inside.

I just tried this recipe last night, because I had 3 overripe bananas hanging out on the counter (and I wanted them gone before we have company this weekend.) Oh, wow! This is my new favorite banana bread–moist, perfect banana flavor, and I love the additional of oats. We had it for breakfast…and then for a snack…and well, we had some for dinner too. Thank you for this AMAZING recipe. I will be making this many, many more times!

This was delicious! I made this recipe into vegan muffins and they turned out perfectly! I used a combination of whole wheat flour and all-purpose since that’s what I had on hand. I realized too late that I didn’t have flax seed or chia seeds, so instead I used Trader Joe’s Super Seed & Ancient Grain Blend, which has both chia seeds, flax seeds, and a bunch of other healthy things. And it only needed to bake for about 20-25 minutes — thank you!

Great recipe! I’ve tried other gluten free banana breads and most seem to come out either gritty or a bit slimy (not very tasty) but this one was perfect, I don’t think anyone would even know it was gluten free. The oats really give it a great texture and it was not overly sweet (which I like but if you want a very sweet banana bread you may need to add more sweetener). I did not have any problems with it crumbling even right out of the oven. Highly recommended!

Unfortunately I didn’t love this recipe (and am a big fan of your blog). This was just too dense and stodgy for me to enjoy as a plain banana cake. It was better the next day when I toasted up the slices and drizzled some maple syrup on. Far more “bread=like” than cakey.

Do you have any suggestions for using this recipe at altitude (~8000ft.)? It seems that no matter what I do, original recipe or with small tweeks, it always ends up like a dense doughy mass of ingredients that won’t cook through and I end up tossing most of it… I’m ready to give up on this one.

Made for Christmas & it was delish…I had doubts that the batter would fit into the loaf pan, but it did perfectly. I used canola oil spray instead of parchment paper.

I only had 1 banana, so I actually cut this recipe down to 1/3 to try it out.
Very yum, a little dense (I used Bob’s GF all-purpose) but still good. I baked it in my convection toaster oven and sprinkled a little coconut sugar and oats on top.
Next time I’d like to try it with the flour blend recommended here. I MIGHT split that recipe into thirds – I’d be curious if adding some yeast might help, but not curious enough to mess up a whole loaf! :P
If I try that (eventually, kitchen reno happening now) I will try to remember to check in.

I don’t usually take time to review recipes. Seems often after all the proposed changes, substitutions and additions the recipe bears little resemblance to the original. This banana bread recipe is an exception….absolutely perfect! Just the right amount of sweetness and density. Yes. It looked crusty and overdone but it wasn’t. Moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I’ve taken all other banana bread recipes out of my recipe box. This is it! Thank you!

This recipe was surprisingly a flop for me! I followed the directions exactly but I found it a bit lacking in flavor and the texture was was to goopy and dense for my liking. After 30 minutes it wasn’t done cooking so I left it in about 20 minutes more, but the texture still wasn’t right. I was hoping by the next day it’d work itself out, but no. The oats also didn’t get cooked all the way.. I would suggest using quick oats instead of whole oats as I did.

This is a nice recipe. It baked up exactly as shown, tastes great and has a wonderful texture. I haven’t made banana bread in a long time because the gf recipes I found were just too complicated. Not this one. One bowl and easy as it gets. Thank you for posting this!

I just made this recipe, as written, with one change: I carmelized the bananas by mashing them and placing them in a saucepan over direct heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. This intensifies and carmelizes the banana flavor. This extra step may discourage cooks who want a truly one-bowl recipe but I think it’s worth it. I was diagnosed with celiac disease just before the holidays and I’ve had to replace recipes that I’ve collected and perfected for well over a decade. I’ve taken gluten free cooking classes and bought a dozen gf baking books, yet was still dissatisfied with every banana bread loaf I’ve made until today. I love the delicate flavor from the almond meal and the chewiness from the oats. It is perfect in every way. Oh, I did let the batter rest for 30 minutes before baking. Thank you!

Hi! This was my first time making anything gluten-free. I love this recipe! It turned out sooooo good. I’m definitely encouraged to try some more of your gf recipes. I missed adding the coconut oil but it still came out moist and tasty. What does that add to flavor/texture? Thanks for posting this recipe!!

I’m anxious to try this recipe but I don’t have almond meal. Can I use almond flour?
If not, what can I substute for the almond meal?

This recipe is awesome! I’m vegan but not GF so I just used AP flour in place of the GF blend, and it turned out great! I love the addition of almond meal, it adds a really subtle yet delicious flavor. I might even add a little almond extract next time (I LOVE almonds). The oats add a nice texture too. This is definitely going to be my new go-to banana bread recipe. Thanks so much for sharing your awesome recipes!

Good morning, had some bananas that needed to be used up and found your recipe on Pinterest. I added a few chocolate chips as well as a big ol scoop of organic peanut butter….yum!

This has become a favorite recipe of mine. I add walnuts and mini chocolate chips, bake for one hour twenty minutes….so good!

Incredible bread. New to GF and I’m amazed at flavor and texture. Great with peanut butter! Does dry over few days and not good for freezing. Eat up!
