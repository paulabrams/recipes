# Simple Tomato Pizza Sauce

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] 1 small onion, chopped
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- [ ] 1 stalk celery, chopped
- [ ] 1 carrot, chopped
- [ ] Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] 2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
- [ ] 4 to 6 fresh basil leaves
- [ ] 2 dried bay leaves
- [ ] 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (optional, for reducing acidity)

## Directions
1. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes.
2. Add celery and carrots, season with salt and pepper. Sauté until all vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.
3. Add tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves. Simmer covered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick.
4. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, to round out the flavors.
5. Add half the tomato sauce to a food processor and process until smooth. Continue with remaining sauce.
6. If not using all the sauce, allow to cool completely and pour 1-2 cup portions into freezer bags. Freezes up to 6 months.

## Tips
- Use high-quality canned tomatoes for best flavor
- The carrot adds natural sweetness and helps balance acidity
- Butter is optional but helps round out acidic flavors
- Can be used immediately or frozen for later use

## Notes
- Perfect base for pizza sauce, pasta dishes, or any recipe calling for tomato sauce
- Makes 6 cups - enough sauce for multiple meals
