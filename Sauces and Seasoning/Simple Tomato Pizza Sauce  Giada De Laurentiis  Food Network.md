###### Ingredients

```
	1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

	1 small onion, chopped

	2 cloves garlic, chopped

	1 stalk celery, chopped

	1 carrot, chopped

	Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

	2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes

	4 to 6 basil leaves

	2 dried bay leaves

	4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional
```

###### Directions

- In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves and simmer covered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors.

- Add half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce.

- If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags. This will freeze up to 6 months.

My husbands nanny from Napoli taught me just canned whole peeled toms, garlic, sometimes paste and lots of salt- that's it. Been making it for 20 yrs. I tried this for fun, I liked it a lot, trying it tonight to put with meatballs, sausage and tripolini pasta-oh and side of rapini

For years I've been on a mission to make the best tomato sauce.  The Italian American recipe has evolved over generations to a point where we use far too many ingredients in our sauce, and after spending years in Italy and getting helpful advice, the answer is fairly straightforward... Do NOT use garlic in your tomato sauce recipe if you are using onions!  The two ingredients cancel each other out in flavour.  Most Italian chefs I have discussed this with in Italy and England are shocked by the fact that so many Americans use both ingredients in the same recipe.  Also, unnecessary ingredients include oregano, sugar and red wine.  Giada's recipe is very close to the real deal, but again, don't use the garlic.  Also, one should note that only a half carrot or a small carrot is necessary.  And cut back the unsalted butter to a maximum of 1 to 2 tablespoons, or else the buttery flavour will stifle the flavour of your tomatoes.  Thanks for the help, Giada.  And good luck everyone.  The recipe is so easy, and hopefully it will become a staple dish in your house.

I loved it! i followed the instructions completely, i thought the basil and bay leaves were perfect. it definitely is a simple sauce with a beautiful subtle flavor. i think the less satisfied reviews were looking for something with a little more kick. i let it simmer longer than an hour, probably an hour and twenty..maybe that helped with the acidity because I didn't have an issue with that, which is good because i'd prefer not to add the extra butter if possible. yum, thanks giada!!

I haven't made this yet but definitely want to try it. I don't have a food processor, is it really necessary to use for this recipe? I don't have a blender or food chopper etc either. Would it be ok to skip that step?
Thanks

Like a previous reviewer, I found it turned bright orange when it put it in the Vitamix. I only used enough EVOO to coat the veggies as they cooked. I wuld only use maybe 1/2 to 1/3 of a carrot if I did this again. Not a lot of taste, kind of bland. Disappointing, since we can no longer buy Giada sauce at Target. Maybe I would add some rosemary and a little oregano.

Great!! Added more garlic and the key is using San Marzano tomatoes or home canned. Great basic sauce.

I was trying the chicken parmesan recipe by her so I thought i would try the sauce recipe that followed and I have to say it was only "ok" to me - little disappointed since it has so many positive reviews - I found it more on the blander side and i even added more spices to it (I am very familiar w/tomato sauce/gravy as I make a "Sunday Gravy" recipe that has been in our Italian family for years and you actually don't need much spice to it at all only garlic and i find that more flavorful than this one. I did everything recipe called for and also during puree it turned orange (and unlike another reviewer who said it was prob from using snacking carrots - um no used a regular carrot) - also added about 2 tbsp of butter still was eh..... maybe the oil is too much (at 1/2 cup) i prob won't make it again........ though the chicken parmesan came out wonderful!

I actually loved this as a base - I roasted on open flame an eggplant wrapped in foil and pureed that into the sauce, I also omitted the bay leaf and added some fresh blanched tomatoes - so my tomato eggplant sauce was smokey and delicious - added slivers of spinach and served over penne
