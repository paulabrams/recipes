## Recipe Details

- **Total Time**: 1 hour 30 minutes
- **Prep Time**: 15 minutes  
- **Cook Time**: 1 hour 15 minutes
- **Yield**: 6 cups
- **Level**: Easy

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 stalk celery, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
- 4 to 6 fresh basil leaves
- 2 dried bay leaves

## Instructions

1. **Sauté vegetables**: In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes.

2. **Add aromatics**: Add celery and carrots, season with salt and pepper. Sauté until all vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.

3. **Simmer sauce**: Add tomatoes, basil, and bay leaves. Simmer covered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick.

4. **Season and adjust**: Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, to round out the flavors.

5. **Blend**: Add half the tomato sauce to a food processor and process until smooth. Continue with remaining sauce.

6. **Store**: If not using all the sauce, allow to cool completely and pour 1-2 cup portions into freezer bags. Freezes up to 6 months.
