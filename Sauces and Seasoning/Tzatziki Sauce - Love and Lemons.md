# Tzatziki Sauce

## Ingredients

- [ ] ½ cup finely grated cucumber
- [ ] 1 cup thick whole milk Greek yogurt
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- [ ] ½ tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] 1 garlic clove, grated
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- [ ] 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- [ ] 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint, optional

## Directions

1. Grate the cucumber using the largest holes on a box grater to give the sauce texture.
2. Place the grated cucumber on a towel and gently squeeze out the excess water. This step is essential for making a creamy tzatziki—if you skip it, the water from the cucumber will cause your sauce to separate. Squeeze the cucumber directly over the sink, or press it lightly between kitchen or paper towels.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the squeezed cucumber, yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, dill, and mint, if using. Stir until well combined.
4. Chill until ready to use.

## Tips

- Use thick whole milk Greek yogurt for best results
- Fresh dill is best, but you can use ½ to 1 teaspoon dried dill in a pinch
- The ½ cup cucumber measurement is before squeezing out the water
- Use the largest holes on a box grater for texture and green flecks in the final sauce

## Notes

- Serves 4 to 6
- Prep time: 5 minutes
- Total time: 5 minutes
- Delicious as a dip with pita and fresh veggies, on sandwiches, with grilled veggies, or served alongside falafel
