# Avocado Goddess Sauce

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 avocados, halved and pitted
- [ ] 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- [ ] 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
- [ ] 1-2 jalapeños, halved (seeded if desired)
- [ ] 1/4 cup lemon juice
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- [ ] 1/4 cup water (more as needed)
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste
- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil (optional, for extra creaminess)

## Directions

### 1. Prep Ingredients
1. Scoop avocado flesh into a blender or food processor
2. Roughly chop cilantro, basil, and jalapeños
3. Add herbs, jalapeños, lemon juice, cumin, water, sea salt, and optional olive oil to the blender

### 2. Blend and Adjust
1. Blend on high until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed
2. Add additional water (1 tablespoon at a time) to reach desired consistency
3. Taste and season with more salt or lemon juice if needed

## Tips
- Seed jalapeños for milder heat; leave seeds in for spicier sauce
- Thin with extra water or olive oil for a pourable dressing
- Keeps its vibrant color longer if stored with plastic wrap pressed against the surface
- Works as a dip, sandwich spread, or drizzle over roasted vegetables and proteins

## Notes
- Inspired by Half Baked Harvest’s Sheet Pan Lemon Chicken with Sweet Potatoes and Avocado Goddess Sauce
- Makes about 2 cups
- Store refrigerated in an airtight container up to 1 week
