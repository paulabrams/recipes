# Ohrid-Style Baked Trout  
**Пастрмка на Охридски начин**

A classic Macedonian preparation from the Lake Ohrid region: simple, olive-oil–forward,
gently baked, and never overworked. This version uses a soaked clay oven dish and a cold-oven
start, which is essential to both the dish and the cookware.

   - Lay the trout in the dish, skin-side down.

## Finish & Serve

1. **Remove and uncover**  
   Remove the clay dish from the oven. Carefully remove the lid to release steam.

   Let rest for **5 minutes**.

3. **Finish**  
   Sprinkle with fresh parsley.  
   Serve with lemon to squeeze at the table.

## Notes

- Never preheat an empty clay dish.
- Sweet paprika is traditional; smoked paprika changes the dish completely.
- This recipe favors moisture and aroma over crispness.
- The olive oil and juices are meant to be soaked up with bread.
