This method emphasizes olive oil, garlic, and sweet paprika, finishing under the broiler for crisp edges and lightly blistered skin.

## Ingredients (Serves 2)

- 2 whole trout, cleaned and butterflied  
  *(or 2 skin-on fillets)*
- 4 tbsp olive oil (don’t skimp)
- 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp sweet paprika (not smoked, not hot)
- 1 lemon, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper

---

## Equipment

- Shallow clay oven dish or heavy baking dish
- Oven with broiler

---

## Preparation

1. **Preheat the oven**  
   Heat oven to **425°F (220°C)**.

2. **Prepare the dish**  
   Oil the clay dish generously. The oil is essential for crisping.

3. **Prepare the trout**  
   Lay trout skin-side down, opened flat if whole.  
   Season well with salt and black pepper.

4. **Add aromatics**  
   Scatter garlic slices evenly.  
   Sprinkle sweet paprika lightly and evenly.  
   Drizzle olive oil generously over the fish.  
   Add lemon slices on top or alongside.

## Baking

1. **Open bake**  
   Bake uncovered for **12–15 minutes**, until the flesh is just set and opaque.

2. **Broil to finish**  
   Switch to broil (high).  
   Broil **2–4 minutes**, watching closely, until:
   - Edges crisp
   - Skin lightly blistered
   - Garlic turns golden (not dark)

---

## Finish

- Remove from oven.
- Sprinkle with fresh parsley.
- Squeeze lemon at the table, not before.

---

## To Serve Traditionally

- Crusty bread to soak the paprika oil
- Shopska salad or sliced tomatoes
- Simple potatoes or nothing at all

---

## Notes

- This is still a **rustic Macedonian preparation**, just less enclosed.
- Crispiness comes from **oil + exposure**, not breading.
- Do not use smoked paprika—this is aromatic, not smoky.
