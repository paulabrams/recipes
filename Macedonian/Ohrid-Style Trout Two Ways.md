# Ohrid-Style Baked Trout (Clay Oven, Shared Oven Timing)
**Пастрмка на Охридски начин**

A traditional Ohrid-style trout prepared in a soaked clay oven dish using a cold-start oven.
This recipe is designed to cook alongside a second, uncovered trout dish that will later be broiled.
The clay dish is removed at the end of the oven stage and is never exposed to direct broiler heat.

## Preparation

1. **Soak the clay dish**  
   Soak both the base and lid in cold water for **10–15 minutes**. Drain but do not dry.

2. **Prepare the trout**  
   Pat the trout dry. Season inside and out with salt and black pepper.

3. **Assemble the dish**  
   - Generously oil the bottom of the clay dish.  
   - Lay the trout skin-side down, opened flat if whole.  
   - Scatter garlic over and inside the fish.  
   - Sprinkle evenly with sweet paprika.  
   - Add lemon slices on top.  
   - Drizzle with remaining olive oil.

## Cooking (Shared Oven Stage)

1. **Cold start**  
   Place the covered clay dish into a **cold oven**.

2. **Heat the oven**  
   Set the oven to **425°F (220°C)**.

3. **Bake covered**  
   Cook for **25–30 minutes**, until the trout is just cooked through, moist, and fragrant.

This timing assumes another trout dish may be cooking uncovered in the same oven.

## Finish & Serve

1. **Remove the clay dish**  
   Take the clay dish out of the oven **before any broiling begins**.

2. **Uncover carefully**  
   Remove the lid, releasing steam.

3. **Rest briefly**  
   Let rest for **5 minutes**.

4. **Finish**  
   Sprinkle with fresh parsley.  
   Serve with lemon to squeeze at the table.

## Notes

- The clay dish should never be placed under the broiler.
- This method prioritizes moisture, aroma, and olive-oil richness over crispness.
- Sweet paprika is essential; smoked paprika is not traditional here.
- The cooking juices are meant to be soaked up with bread.
