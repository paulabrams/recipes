This is the secret to making some of the easiest, best chicken right in your home oven. The spices come together incredibly well and the chicken come out so juicy, so flavorful, and it makes for easy meals all week long. You can make high protein bowls, tacos, quesadillas, or just pair the chicken with your favorite air fried veggies. I used my [@kaizenfoodco](https://www.instagram.com/kaizenfoodco/) high protein low carb rice, but use whatever rice you prefer!  
  
Here is how to make it:  
  
1 Start with 2.5 lbs boneless chicken thighs. Trim off any excess fat to the extent you’d like and place inside a large bowl.  
  
2 Season the chicken with a few generous pinches of salt & pepper, 1 tbsp paprika, 1 tbsp Aleppo pepper or chili flakes of choice, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1/2 tbsp chipotle powder, 1/2 tsp coriander, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. We’ll also add 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, 1 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp yogurt, and juice of 1 large lime to add a lot more flavor and tenderize the chicken.  
  
3 Mix it super well, then thinly slice 1/2 large red onion and mix it in with the chicken. You ideally let this marinate for 2-4 hrs but if you want to make it right away, you can.  
  
4 When you’re ready to make it, remove the chicken from the fridge and let it come up to room temp before placing it in the oven, about 30 mins. Then preheat your oven to 425F. Pack the marinated chicken tightly inside a loaf pan (my size is roughly 8.5x4.5x2.5). Place in the oven for 50-55 mins at 425F.  
  
5 Remove the chicken from the oven, tilt the pan over a glass bowl or container to pour out the excess juices. I like to pour this over the chicken before serving, or even use it as a broth or base for soups.  
  
6 Flip the pan over a cutting board and cut the chicken into strips, cubes, or whatever shape you like.  
  
7 Then serve it however way you wish.
