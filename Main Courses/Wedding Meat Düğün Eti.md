# Wedding Meat Düğün Eti

Another wedding feast dish. Ingredient quantities have been scaled down considerably—even the Turks don't wait for a wedding just to prepare this spicy lamb dish.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 6 lamb shoulder chops, cut 1½ in (4 cm) thick
- [ ] ¼ cup (2 oz/60 g) butter
- [ ] 2 medium-sized onions, chopped
- [ ] 1½ cups (9 oz/280 g) chopped, peeled tomatoes
- [ ] 1 cup (8 fl oz/250 ml) water
- [ ] 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- [ ] ½ teaspoon whole allspice, crushed
- [ ] 3 cloves
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] Freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] Broiled (grilled) tomato slices, for serving
- [ ] Wedding Pilaf (Düğün Pilavı), for serving (optional)

## Directions

### 1. Prepare the Lamb

1. Trim the lamb shoulder chops of excess fat
2. Season chops with salt and freshly ground black pepper

### 2. Brown the Meat

1. Melt butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat
2. Brown the lamb chops on both sides, working in batches if necessary
3. Remove chops and set aside

### 3. Cook Onions and Tomatoes

1. Add chopped onions to the same pot and cook until softened
2. Add chopped tomatoes and cook for a few minutes

### 4. Add Spices and Simmer

1. Add ground cinnamon, crushed allspice, and cloves to the pot
2. Return the browned lamb chops to the pot
3. Add water and bring to a boil
4. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for about 1½ hours, or until lamb is very tender
5. Check occasionally and add more water if needed

### 5. Finish and Serve

1. Once lamb is tender, arrange on a serving platter
2. Pour the sauce over the meat
3. Serve with broiled tomato slices and Wedding Pilaf if desired

## Tips

- The lamb should be very tender and falling off the bone when done
- Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper before serving
- The sauce should be rich and flavorful from the long simmering
- If the sauce is too thin, remove the chops and reduce the sauce over higher heat

## Notes

- Serves 6
- Cooking time: 2 hours
- Traditional Turkish wedding feast dish
- Best served with rice pilaf and grilled tomato slices
