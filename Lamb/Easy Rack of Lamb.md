## Directions

1. **Prep Lamb:** Season lamb racks with salt and pepper. Let come to room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

2. **Prep Potatoes:** Add potatoes to a large pot of cold, salted water. Cook over medium heat until tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain and place on a large baking sheet.

3. **Make Marinade:** In a food processor, combine Dijon mustard, garlic, ¼ cup olive oil, and 2 tablespoons rosemary. Process until finely chopped and combined.

4. **Preheat Oven:** Set oven to 425°F (220°C) with rack in top third of oven.

5. **Sear Lamb:** Heat cast iron pot over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil. When hot, sear lamb racks fat side down first, 1-2 minutes per side.

6. **Prepare Potatoes:** Use back of spoon to gently smash potatoes flat. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt, pepper, and remaining rosemary.

7. **Roast:** Lay seared lamb racks on top of potatoes, bones curving down (fat side up). Spoon marinade over lamb. Roast 15-25 minutes until internal temperature reaches 120-130°F for rare or 130-140°F for medium rare.

8. **Rest:** Transfer lamb to cutting board and tent with foil. Rest 15 minutes.

9. **Crisp Potatoes:** Return potatoes to oven for 10 more minutes until crispy.

10. **Serve:** Slice lamb between bones. Arrange on serving platter with potatoes. Garnish with fresh parsley.
