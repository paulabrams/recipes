## 🔪 Instructions

1. **Preheat** oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line an 8″ square or 9″ springform pan.
2. **Make chocolate syrup:**  
   In a small saucepan, bring **½ cup sugar** and **½ cup water** to a simmer. Stir until sugar dissolves, then remove from heat and add the **chopped chocolate**, stirring until melted. Let cool slightly.
3. **Prepare batter:**  
   In a large bowl, beat **egg yolks** with remaining **¼ cup sugar** until pale and thick. Stir in **ground walnuts** and **matzo meal**, then mix in the **chocolate syrup**.
4. **Beat egg whites:**  
   In a separate clean bowl, beat **egg whites** until they form stiff peaks. Gently fold into the chocolate-nut mixture in thirds, being careful not to deflate the batter.
5. **Bake:**  
   Pour into prepared pan and smooth top. Bake for **30–40 minutes** or until the top is puffed and the center is nearly set. A toothpick inserted **1″ from the edge** should come out clean.
6. **Cool:**  
   Let cool completely in the pan on a rack. Run a knife around the edge before unmolding.
