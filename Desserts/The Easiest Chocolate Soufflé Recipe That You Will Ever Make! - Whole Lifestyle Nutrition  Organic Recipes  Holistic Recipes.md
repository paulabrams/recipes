Did I say **Chocolate**??? Oh yeah I did, and look at this ooey, gooey little treasure that I am about to share with you!!! !\[\[IMG_6800.jpg\]\]

So for years now I have been wanting to make a soufflé and I have never attempted to make one because I have always heard that they were so hard to make!  I  have always seen such beautiful recipes but the directions were always so detailed and have always scared me away if I am being honest!

So I set out to find a delicious soufflé recipe that would take no time at all to make.  **Let me tell you, I hit the jackpot with this incredibly easy recipe!**

!\[\[IMG_6812-2.jpg\]\]

There are a couple of things I want to touch on.  One, when a soufflé comes out of the oven is going to be nice and tall and look like it’s about to pop out of the ramekin (look at the pictures above).

**Note: The soufflé will fall a bit as it sits, this is normal.** There are ways to make it not fall, but it was way to complicated in my opinion.  Still taste the same fallen or not.

If you look at this picture (below) you can see that it has fallen about an inch.  Again, this is normal.

This soufflé has a mouse like texture that is velvety and dreamy!  **It is suppose to be gooey and light and airy!**  This is normal too!

As you can see, **I had no problem at all digging into my soufflé and I will definitely be making this again!**  Enjoy!

The Easiest Chocolate Soufflé Recipe That You Will Ever Make!

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 12 minutes

Total Time: 27 minutes

Yield: 6 servings

Serving Size: 1 serving

See **nutritional information** below this recipe. There are 6 servings in the recipe, the nutritional information given is for 1 serving.

Ingredients

- grass fed butter to rub on the ramekins

- \[rapadura (unrefined sugar)to dust the ramekins

- 3 oz of bittersweet chocolate cut into small shavings (I used Lindt 85% dark chocolate, it has no soy in it making it a great choice) If you are gluten free you can use Enjoy Life Mini Chocolate Chips

- 1/3 cup half and half

- 1/3 cup water

- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

- 8 egg whites

- 1/2 cup rapadura unrefined sugar

- organic powder sugar for dusting (optional)

Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 F.

- Rub 6 (3" diameter) ramekins with butter on the bottoms and sides.
- Add a little sugar (rapadura) and move it around in the ramekin so that it coats the bottom and the sides of the dish. Discard any extra.
- In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the half and half just until you see bubbles forming on the side of the dish.
- Remove from heat and add chocolate shavings and stir until melted.
- Place your chocolate mixture into a double boiler. Stir in unsweetened cocoa powder and water and stir until hot. Remove from double boiler when hot and set aside.
- In a deep metal dish, add 8 egg whites and beat on medium high speed until slightly foamy (about 1 minute).
- Start adding the sugar one tablespoon at a time and continue to beat the egg whites until sugar is all gone.
- Beat the egg whites until you have a soft peak (for me this was about 3 minutes). Do not over beat into a stiff peak.
- Fold in one third of the egg white mixture into the warm chocolate mix. Make sure you fold it in and NOT stir it in.
- Now add the chocolate mixture into the remaining egg whites (in the metal dish) and gently fold them in.
- Fold in only until the egg whites are well incorporated into the mixture. It is ok if you have some streaks in your batter.
- Fill the ramekins almost to the top, leaving 1/4" space from the top.
- Wipe the rim of the dish to remove and batter or sugar from the rim.
- Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the top is lightly brown.
- Dust with powder sugar and serve immediately
