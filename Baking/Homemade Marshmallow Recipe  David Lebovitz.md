# Homemade Marshmallows

## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 envelopes (17g) powdered gelatin or 17g sheet gelatin (8 to 10 sheets)
- [ ] 1/2 cup (125ml) + 1/3 cup (80ml) cold water
- [ ] 1 cup (200g) sugar
- [ ] 1/3 cup (100g) light corn syrup
- [ ] 4 large egg whites (1/2 cup, 110g), at room temperature
- [ ] Pinch of salt
- [ ] 2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon vanilla paste

### For Dusting
- [ ] 1 cup (140g) cornstarch (or potato starch)
- [ ] 1 cup (140g) powdered sugar

## Directions
1. In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the 1/2 cup (125ml) of cold water to dissolve and soften. If using leaf gelatin, soak the leaves in about 2 cups (500ml) cold water.
2. In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, mix the sugar and corn syrup with 1/3 cup (80ml) of water. Place over medium-to-high heat.
3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, pour in the egg whites and beat on low speed until frothy. Add the pinch of salt.
4. When the syrup reaches about 210ºF (99ºC), increase the speed of the mixer to high and beat the whites until they are thick and fluffy.
5. When the syrup reaches 245ºF (118ºC), while the mixer is running on high speed, slowly pour the hot syrup into the whites, avoiding the whisk to prevent splattering.
6. Scrape the gelatin and water into the pan that you used for the syrup, or put the gelatin sheets and 2 tablespoons of the water into the pan and swirl to dissolve.
7. Pour the liquified gelatin slowly into the whites as they are whipping. Add the vanilla extract and continue to whip for 5 minutes, until the mixture feels completely cool when you touch the outside of the bowl.
8. Mix cornstarch and powdered sugar together. Dust a baking sheet evenly and completely with a generous layer of this mixture. Make sure there are absolutely no bare spots.
9. Use a spatula to spread the marshmallows in a layer on the pan. Allow to dry for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, uncovered.
10. Dust the top of the marshmallows with some of the cornstarch/powdered sugar mixture. Use a pizza cutter or scissors (dusted as well) to cut the marshmallows into desired shapes and toss in the mixture. Shake vigorously in a wire strainer to remove excess powder.

## Tips
- Use a candy thermometer for accurate temperature readings
- You can add flavors like cinnamon, peppermint oil, or espresso powder during final beating stage
- Can substitute some water with liquor for adult versions

## Notes
- Yield: 25-50 marshmallows depending on size
- Storage: Keep in airtight container for up to one week
- Requires candy thermometer and electric mixer
