## Ingredients
- [ ] 2 egg whites
- [ ] 1 large egg
- [ ] 1/2 cup water
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1/8 teaspoon yeast
- [ ] 1 1/2 tablespoons honey
- [ ] 1/2 cup flax seeds, ground

- [ ] 1 tablespoon oil for pan

## Directions
1. Mix egg whites and whole egg together
2. Stir in water, salt, yeast, and honey
3. Grind flax seeds and add to the mixture
4. Let stand to absorb - mixture should become slimy and thickened
5. Stir in millet flour and let stand until moisture absorbs slightly
6. Mix in tapioca flour - dough will be wetter and stickier than regular bread dough
7. Cover with a towel and place in warm spot to rise for approximately 45 minutes

## Tips
- The dough will be much wetter and stickier than traditional bread dough
- Ground flax seeds act as a binding agent in place of gluten
- Let the mixture rest to allow flax to fully absorb liquids

## Notes
- Gluten-free bread without gums
- Rising time: 45 minutes
