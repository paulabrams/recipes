# Blackberry Buckwheat Cream Scones

## Ingredients
- [ ] 3/4 cup arrowroot starch
- [ ] 3/4 cup buckwheat flour
- [ ] 2 cups almond flour
- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1 tablespoon baking powder
- [ ] 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
- [ ] 3 tablespoons hot water
- [ ] 8 oz organic coconut milk (full fat), plus extra for brushing tops
- [ ] 4 oz maple syrup (grade B preferred)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- [ ] 1 cup blackberries
- [ ] 1/2 cup organic sucanat for sprinkling

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 425Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat.
2. In a large bowl, combine arrowroot starch, buckwheat flour, almond flour, salt, and baking powder with a whisk.
3. In a small bowl, add flaxseed meal and hot water. Stir together with a fork making a slurry. Set aside.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk coconut milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract.
5. Add half of liquid mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a fork. Add the flaxseed slurry and the rest of the liquids. The dough will be more like a thick batter.
6. Carefully fold in blackberries.
7. Using a 1/4 cup, scoop and drop batter on prepared baking sheet.
8. With a pastry brush, brush tops of scones with extra coconut milk. Sprinkle with sucanat.
9. Bake for 16 minutes, or until tops start to turn golden brown.
10. Remove scones from baking sheet and place on wire rack. Serve warm.
