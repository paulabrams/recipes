# Just Nutz Bars (Maple Syrup Version)

## Ingredients

### Nuts & Seeds
- [ ] ½ cup pecans, roughly chopped
- [ ] ½ cup walnuts, roughly chopped
- [ ] ½ cup almonds, roughly chopped
- [ ] ¼ cup pumpkin seeds
- [ ] ¼ cup sunflower seeds
- [ ] 2 Tbsp flax seeds
- [ ] ¼ cup unsweetened shredded coconut

### Crunch & Chocolate
- [ ] ½ cup plain crisp rice cereal
- [ ] ¼ cup dairy-free chocolate chips

### Binder & Flavor
- [ ] ¼ cup smooth almond butter, plus 1 Tbsp
- [ ] 3 Tbsp pure maple syrup
- [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract
- [ ] ¼ tsp fine sea salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C). Line an 8×8-inch pan with parchment paper.
2. Spread pecans, walnuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and flax seeds on a baking sheet. Toast for 8–10 minutes, stirring once, until fragrant.
3. Transfer toasted nuts and seeds to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Stir in coconut and rice cereal.
4. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm almond butter, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt. Stir until smooth and pourable (do not boil).
5. Pour the warm binder over the nut mixture. Stir until evenly coated. Fold in chocolate chips last.
6. Press mixture very firmly into the prepared pan. Bake for 14–16 minutes, until set but not browned.
7. Cool completely in the pan. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (overnight is best). Lift out and cut into bars.

## Tips
- For firmer bars: add 1 Tbsp ground flax or 1 Tbsp melted coconut oil.
- For less sweetness: reduce chocolate chips to 2 Tbsp.
- Always press firmly—this matters more when using maple syrup.
