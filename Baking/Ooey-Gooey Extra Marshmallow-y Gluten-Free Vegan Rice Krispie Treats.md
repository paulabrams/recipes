## Ingredients

### Rice Krispie Base
- [ ] 3-4 tablespoons coconut oil (or non-dairy butter)
- [ ] 22 vegan marshmallows (normal size – not mini)
- [ ] 4 cups gluten-free Rice Krispies cereal

### Marshmallow Layer
- [ ] 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- [ ] 20 vegan marshmallows (normal size – not mini)

### Chocolate Drizzle
- [ ] 1/2 cup semi-sweet (or dark) vegan chocolate chips
- [ ] 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- [ ] 1 tablespoon maple syrup (optional, adds gloss)
- [ ] 3 tablespoons non-dairy milk

## Directions

### Rice Krispie Base
1. Line an 11x7" baking dish with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Melt coconut oil on medium-low heat. Add marshmallows and allow them to melt into fluff by continuously stirring and breaking them up with a wooden spoon.
3. Add rice krispies cereal and mix the entire mixture thoroughly.
4. Transfer mixture into baking dish. Use 2 spoons to help with the sticky mixture. Use a sheet of parchment paper to flatten and press the mixture down as much as possible.
5. Put the pan in the fridge to cool while you prepare the marshmallow layer.

### Marshmallow Layer
6. Follow step 2 from above to warm up and melt down marshmallows with coconut oil.
7. Remove rice krispies from the fridge. Scoop out the melted marshmallow fluff and spread it out over the rice krispies mixture. Move quickly while mixture is warm.

### Chocolate Drizzle
8. Melt chocolate using a double boiler: Bring water in a small sauce pan to a boil. Place a glass heat-proof bowl on top (make sure it's not touching the water). Place chocolate chips, coconut oil, and maple syrup in the bowl. Allow mixture to melt, stirring frequently.
9. Once chocolate is melted, add the non-dairy milk, one tablespoon at a time. Mix thoroughly between each addition.
10. Quickly transfer chocolate mixture into a piping bag, and drizzle over the marshmallow layer.
11. Allow to cool for another 5-10 minutes at room temperature.
12. Carefully lift out the rice krispie treats using parchment paper and transfer onto a cutting board. Cut into squares and serve.
