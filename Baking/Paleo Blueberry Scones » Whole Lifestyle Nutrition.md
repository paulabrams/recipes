### My Love Obsession With These Paleo Blueberry Scones

I am in love with these **Paleo blueberry scones** for several reasons!

- They taste amazing!

- They are full of protein.

- They are grain free, gluten free & Paleo.

- And, they are super easy to make!!

Oh and I forgot to mention that the juice from the blueberries just drizzles right out of the blueberries creating an amazing and some what juicy scone.

These Paleo blueberry scones are super moist and the blueberries just pop with flavor and the texture is so amazing!

### Making Your Own Blanched Almond Butter

There is a star ingredient to making this terrific scones recipe.  It is  **blanched almond butter**!

I know, many of you might be wondering why I use “blanched” almond butter over “regular” almond butter. In short…**it is easier to digest.**

I wrote an article last month that includes a terrific recipe and **explains the benefits of blanched almond butter and how to make your own**. Be sure to check it out.

Now I will note here, if you’d like to make these scones with regular almond butter, you sure can. It will still taste delicious!

### Homemade Powdered Sugar & Glaze Made Without Cane Sugar

Why not step it up a notch by drizzling a glaze right over top of the scones.  Can you taste it now??

I know many steer away from powdered sugar and I can totally understand why.  But what if I told you that you can make your own powdered sugar without using cane sugar at all!  Would you try it.

Better yet, what if I told you it could be made in less than 1 minute, now do I have your attention? \*\*

Now lets move onto this delicious scones recipe that the whole family can enjoy!

   Wow, these paleo blueberry scones are so super delicious. I used raw almond butter and did not do the glaze, they turned out beautiful.
