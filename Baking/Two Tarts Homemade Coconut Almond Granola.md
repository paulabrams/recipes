### Homemade Coconut Almond Granola

Homemade granola is another one of those things that tastes _much_ better than the store-bought variety, is incredibly simple to make at home, and in the end costs a lot less than buying a box of cereal at the grocery store.

You know how we try to avoid things like Yellow Dye #5 and high fructose corn syrup?  I just read about a \[new one the other day – cellulose (wood pulp)!  Are you kidding me?  \*shudder\*
But back to the delicious granola! Dulcie was a little worried that homemade granola would have a sort of weird 70s hippie commune vibe, but I won her over by using big curls and flakes of real unsweetened coconut, local honey, coconut oil, and a smattering of tiny sesame seeds for their delicious taste and texture.

Making one huge batch of granola is super easy. After baking, I let it cool completely on its baking sheet then store it in glass jars in my pantry and enjoy its prettiness all week.

We’ve been eating our latest batch topped with fresh blueberries and whole milk.  Mmmm!

After mixing together the dry ingredients, you need to melt the sweetener and oil together stovetop, then drizzle over all the dry ingredients. I like to use honey and coconut oil but you could sub in equal amounts of maple syrup or agave for sweetness; vegetable oil for the fat.

> Spread the raw granola thinly and equally over two rimmed baking sheets
