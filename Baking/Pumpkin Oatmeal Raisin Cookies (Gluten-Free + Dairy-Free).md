I love this time of year, seeing pumpkin everything, everywhere! I say bring it on. I myself have already consumed several pounds of pumpkin puree and it isn’t even October yet. Of course, sweets and baked goods are high on my list of favorite ways to enjoy pumpkin. Cookies, pies, tarts, muffins, any of them – just add some aromatic spices and I am all about it. These cookies are one of my favorite pumpkin recipes – they are soft and chewy, with a great texture from the oats, plus the spices and the raisins are the perfect compliment. If you would prefer chocolate, leave out the raisins and opt for mini chocolate chips instead – chocolate and pumpkin are amazing together!

What are some of your favorite ways to enjoy pumpkin this time of year?

\*\*Chewy Pumpkin Oatmeal Raisin Cookies (Gluten-Free + Dairy-free)
\*\*_makes approximately 2 dozen cookies_

2 cups blanched almond flour – I use Honeyville brand, it works the best
2 cups rolled oats (not instant) – certified gluten-free if you are intolerant
1 cup fresh pumpkin puree (canned will also work)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup grapeseed oil (olive oil, melted coconut oil or ghee would also work)
1/2 cup organic local honey (maple syrup would be great here, too)
1 large farm fresh brown egg (or egg replacement of your choice)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup raisins (dried cranberries or mini chocolate chips would also be delicious)
1 1/2 tablespoons flaxseed (optional)

Preheat the oven to 375º F, line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.

In a small bowl, whisk together the oil and honey until smooth and well blended. Mix in the egg, pumpkin and vanilla.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry, stir to combine well, add in the oats, raisins and flaxseed, stir until everything is well combined.

Drop the batter by rounded tablespoons 2-inches apart on the baking sheets, flatten the dough gently with a fork. Bake the cookies for 18-20 minutes until they are moist and soft but appear to be dull on the outside and are starting to lightly brown. Rotate the baking sheets during baking for even heating (I rotated mine every 6 minutes). Remove the cookies from the baking sheet after a few minutes and allow to cool on a wire rack. Or eat one while they are still warm, you know you want to!

Once the cookies are cool, store in an airtight container at room temperature.
