## Ingredients
- [ ] 3 cups rolled oats
- [ ] 1 cup large flake coconut (unsweetened)
- [ ] 1 cup coarsely chopped raw almonds
- [ ] 1/2 cup raw sesame seeds
- [ ] 1/2 cup honey
- [ ] 1/2 cup coconut oil

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F
2. Combine all dry ingredients (oats, coconut, almonds, sesame seeds) in a large bowl
3. Melt the honey and coconut oil together in a small pot on the stovetop
4. When melted, drizzle over the dry ingredients and toss with your hands to coat thoroughly
5. Spread the raw granola thinly and evenly over two rimmed baking sheets
6. Bake for 15 minutes, or until toasty golden brown
7. Check after 10 minutes and give a quick stir to help everything brown evenly

## Tips
