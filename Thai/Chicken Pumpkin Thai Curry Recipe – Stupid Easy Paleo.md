# Chicken Pumpkin Thai Curry

## Ingredients

### For the Aromatic Base
- [ ] 6 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
- [ ] 2 shallots, peeled and chopped
- [ ] 1-inch fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
- [ ] 2-inches lemongrass, sliced finely
- [ ] 1-3 teaspoons water (as needed)

### For the Curry
- [ ] 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- [ ] 3 tablespoons aromatic base (from above)
- [ ] 2 tablespoons red curry paste
- [ ] 1.5 cans (20 oz/600 mL) full-fat coconut milk
- [ ] 1 teaspoon fish sauce (optional)
- [ ] 1 lb sweet pumpkin, butternut squash or other hard squash, peeled, seeded and diced
- [ ] 1 lb chicken breast or boneless thigh meat, diced
- [ ] Limes and Thai basil or cilantro, for garnish
- [ ] Bird's eye chilis or hot red chilies (optional, for heat)

## Directions
1. Make the aromatic base: In a food processor, combine garlic, shallots, ginger, and lemongrass. Pulse to break down into very fine pieces.
2. Add 1 tablespoon of water to get everything moving. Add 1-3 more teaspoons of water as needed to form a paste. Scrape down sides frequently.
3. Reserve 3 tablespoons (about half) for this recipe and refrigerate or freeze the rest for next time.
4. In a large pot over medium-high heat, add coconut oil. Once it shimmers, add 3 tablespoons of aromatic base and red curry paste.
5. Stir and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
6. Add coconut milk and fish sauce (if using).
7. For pumpkin version: Add chicken first, bring to boil. After 5 minutes, reduce to simmer and add pumpkin. Cook 10-15 minutes total until pumpkin is tender but not too soft.
8. For squash version: Add squash first, bring to boil, then simmer 8-10 minutes until tender. Add chicken and cook 5 more minutes until cooked through.
9. Garnish with lime wedges and sliced Thai basil or cilantro.

## Tips
- This is a mild curry - add sliced bird's eye chilis for more heat
- A mini food processor works best for the aromatic base
- Can use mortar and pestle instead, but takes more time
