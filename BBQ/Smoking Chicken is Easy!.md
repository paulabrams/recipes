# Smoking Chicken is Easy!

A complete guide to smoking chicken that delivers melt-in-your-mouth, smoke-flavored results that are far easier than grilling. Low and slow is the secret to this incomparable barbecue experience.

## Equipment Needed

- Vertical "wet-pan" type smoker (gas, electric, or charcoal)
- Hardwood chips or chunks (pecan, oak, mesquite, cherry, apple - hickory is strong but great!)
- Oven thermometer (for accurate temperature monitoring)
- Instant-read probe thermometer
- Long, strong tongs
- Insulated food gloves (recommended)
- Chimney starter (for charcoal smokers)

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken:
- 1 fresh, plump 3-5 pound broiler-fryer chicken

### Basic Dry Rub:
- 1/4 cup dark brown sugar (packed) or turbinado sugar
- 1/4 cup sweet paprika (Hungarian preferred)
- 3 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp ground black pepper (freshly ground)
- 1 tbsp garlic powder (or 2 tbsp granulated garlic)
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tbsp cayenne powder

## Instructions

### Prepare the Chicken:
1. **Clean and prep**: Remove chicken from refrigerator, clean and rinse thoroughly, then pat completely dry.

2. **Apply rub**: Generously apply the rub over all pieces, including under the skin if possible. For best results, rub 1-3 days before cooking and keep refrigerated.

### Prepare the Smoker:
3. **Fill water pan**: Fill to within 1 inch of the top (at least 2/3 full) with hot water.

4. **Prepare wood**: 
   - For gas/electric: Place pre-soaked chips (20 minutes to 1 hour) in wood chip box
   - For charcoal: Soak 3-4 cups of chips/chunks for about an hour, then place directly on coals

5. **Heat smoker**: Bring temperature to 235°F (113°C) and maintain between 200-235°F (93-113°C).

### Smoking Process:
6. **Place chicken**: Put chicken in smoker breast-side down initially.

7. **First phase**: Smoke for 1.5-2 hours, then flip breast-side up to finish.

8. **Monitor temperature**: Cook until internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) at the meatiest part of the breast.

9. **Total time**: Plan for approximately 1 hour per pound, typically 4+ hours total.

10. **Rest**: Let chicken rest for at least 10 minutes before serving to allow juices to redistribute.

## Temperature Guidelines

- **Smoker temperature**: 235°F (113°C) - maintain steady temperature
- **Final internal temperature**: 160°F (71°C) in the thickest part of the breast
- **Resting**: Allow chicken to "finish" to 165°F (74°C) during rest period

## Tips for Success

- **Patience is key**: Low and slow cooking is essential
- **Resist peeking**: Only open smoker when necessary - you lose heat and smoke
- **Temperature control**: Use bottom vents only for temperature control, keep top vent open
- **Don't pierce**: Use tongs instead of forks to avoid losing juices
- **Water pan**: Maintains moisture and helps regulate temperature
- **Wood amount**: Don't over-smoke - too much wood makes chicken bitter

## Notes

- One full box of wood chips lasts the entire cooking time
- For safety, always cook chicken to proper internal temperature
- Can be served with or without barbecue sauce
- This method works for whole chickens or pieces
