# BBQ Chicken

## Ingredients
- [ ] Chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks, or whole chicken)
- [ ] BBQ sauce
- [ ] Salt and pepper
- [ ] Your favorite dry rub seasoning

## Directions
1. Season chicken with salt, pepper, and dry rub
2. Preheat smoker or grill to 275°F
3. Cook chicken until internal temperature reaches 150°F
4. Increase temperature to 400°F
5. Continue cooking until internal temperature reaches 160°F
6. Brush with BBQ sauce during final 10 minutes
7. Rest for 5 minutes before serving

## Tips
- Use a meat thermometer for accurate temperature readings
- Dark meat (thighs, drumsticks) can go to 165°F for optimal texture
- Apply sauce only in the last 10-15 minutes to prevent burning

## Notes
- Cooking time varies based on chicken piece size
- Internal temperature is more important than time
- Let chicken rest to allow juices to redistribute
