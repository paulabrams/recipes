## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 rack of lamb (8 ribs, about 2 lbs)
- [ ] Salt and black pepper
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped
- [ ] 1 teaspoon fresh sage, chopped
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
- [ ] 1 teaspoon oregano or marjoram
- [ ] 2-3 tablespoons olive oil

## Directions
1. Season rack of lamb with salt and pepper 2 hours before cooking
2. Mix garlic, rosemary, thyme, sage, parsley, oregano, and additional salt and pepper
3. Add olive oil to herb mixture to help it stick
4. Rub herb mixture all over the lamb rack
5. Preheat smoker to 225°F
6. Smoke lamb for about 1 hour until internal temperature reaches 135°F
7. Remove from smoker and heat cast iron skillet over high heat
8. Sear lamb on all sides for 1-2 minutes per side (reverse sear)
9. Rest for 5-10 minutes before carving

## Tips
- Use a meat thermometer for accurate temperature reading
- The reverse sear adds beautiful color and crust
- Don't overcook - lamb is best served medium-rare to medium

## Notes
- Medium rare is 130°F, medium is 140°F
- Smoking to 135°F allows for 5°F increase during searing
- Serves 2-3 people
- Total cooking time: about 1 hour smoking + 5 minutes searing
