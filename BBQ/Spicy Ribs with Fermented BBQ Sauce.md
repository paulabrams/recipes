# Spicy Ribs with Fermented BBQ Sauce

A delectable Father's Day-worthy recipe that doesn't require a grill. The fermented sauce provides intense flavor and tenderizes the meat for an unparalleled finger-licking good experience.

## Ingredients

### For the Fermented BBQ Sauce (Yield: ~3 cups):
- 1 1/2 tbsp sea salt
- 2 1/2 cups filtered water
- 1-2 dried chipotle chiles
- 1-2 dried ancho chiles
- 1/4 cup cacao nibs
- 6 oz firm tomatoes, seeded and roughly chopped
- 2-3 shallots or 1/2 small onion, roughly cut
- 1-2 jalapeños, seeded
- 6-7 fresh sage leaves
- 1/4 cup blackstrap molasses

### For the Ribs:
- 5 lbs beef ribs
- 1 1/2 cups fermented BBQ sauce (for marinade)
- 1 1/2 cups fermented BBQ sauce (for dipping)

## Instructions

### Make the Fermented BBQ Sauce:

1. **Prepare brine**: Bring filtered water to a boil and dissolve the salt to make the brine. Allow to cool completely.

2. **Prepare chiles**: Soak the dried chipotle and ancho chiles in warm water for about 20 minutes. Drain.

3. **Layer ingredients**: Place ingredients into a quart-size, wide-mouth mason jar in this order:
   - Cacao nibs first
   - Tomato pieces
   - All remaining ingredients EXCEPT molasses

4. **Pack and brine**: Using a wooden spoon, lightly tamp down ingredients so they're level with the jar's shoulder. Pour in brine until it reaches 1 inch above the ingredients.

5. **Ferment**: Cover with fermentation lid and allow to ferment for 7-10 days.

6. **Strain and blend**: When ready, strain the ferment but reserve the liquid. Place fermented ingredients and molasses into a blender with about 1/4 cup of the fermented liquid. Blend until smooth, adding more liquid as needed for a thick, ketchup-like consistency.

### Prepare the Ribs:

7. **Marinate**: Pour 1 1/2 cups of sauce over raw ribs and marinate for 24-48 hours. Turn ribs over at midpoint to ensure even marination.

8. **Preheat oven**: Set to 275°F (135°C). Low temperature retains moisture and flavor.

9. **Prepare for baking**: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and place ribs in a single layer.

10. **Bake**: Cook for 3 hours or until ribs are very tender.

11. **Serve**: Serve with remaining fermented BBQ sauce for dipping.

## Notes

- Don't discard extra fermented liquid - use it in salad dressings or spicy cocktails
