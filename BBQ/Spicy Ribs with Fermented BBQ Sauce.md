# Spicy Ribs with Fermented BBQ Sauce

Summer is here and that means BBQ season. And with that is also Father's Day! Here's a delectable recipe that every Dad would love, and it doesn't even require a grill. The fermented sauce provides a ton of flavor and tenderizes the meat for an unparalleled finger-licking good gustatory experience.

**Ingredients:**
_For the sauce -_
Yield: approx. 3 cups

1-1/2 Tablespoons sea salt
2-1/2 cups filtered water
1 - 2 dried chipotle
1 -2 dried ancho chiles
1/4 cup cacao nibs
6 oz. tomatoes, firm, seeded and roughly chopped
2 - 3 shallots or 1/2 of a small onion, roughly cut
1 -2 jalapenos, seeded
6 - 7 fresh sage leaves
1/4 cup black strap molasses

_For the ribs_ -

5 lbs beef ribs
1-1/2 cups Fermented BBQ Sauce for marinade
1-1/2 cups Fermented BBQ Sauce for dipping

1\. Bring filtered water to a boil and dissolve the salt to make the brine. Allow the brine to cool completely.
2\. Soak the dried chipotle and ancho chiles in warm water for about 20 minutes. Drain.
3\. Place the ingredients into a quart-size, wide-mouth mason jar. Start with the cacao nibs first, then tomato dices, and the rest of the ingredients, EXCEPT the molasses.
4\. Using a wooden spoon or Kraut Source pounder, lightly tamper down the ingredients so that they are leveled with the shoulder of the jar.
5\. Pour in the brine until it reaches one inch above the top of the ingredients.
6\. Place Kraut Source onto the jar and allow to ferment for 7 - 10 days.
7\. When ready, strain the ferment, but reserve the liquid.
8\. Place the fermented ingredients and the black strap molasses into a blender with about 1/4 cup of the fermented liquid and blend until smooth. Add in a little more liquid as needed, but not too much! As the consistency should be thick, like ketchup.

9\. Pour 1-1/2 cups of the sauce over raw ribs and marinade for 24 - 48 hours. Turn the ribs over at mid-point to ensure that all both sides are evenly marinaded.
10\. Pre-heat oven to 275 degrees F. (Baking the ribs in a low temperature retains moisture and flavor. Of course, you can also use a barbecue too.)
11\. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and place the ribs in a single layer.
12\. Bake for 3 hours or until ribs are very tender.

(Note: Don't toss the extra fermented liquid. Save it to use in a salad dressing, or add to make spicy cocktails, etc.)
