For the brine:
4 cups water
1/4 cup kosher salt
Garlic-  seriously- lots of garlic
Herbs.  I use sage, thyme, and oregano because they work with pork, but any herbs
1/4-1/2 cup apple cider vinegar.  I make my own from my apple trees, but anything real with a “mother” is good. If beef, red wine vinegar is also good. But apple cider with a Mother will begin breaking down the meat better.Boil it together until the salt melts in the water.  Add 4 cups of ice to cool.  Keep adding a little more ice, until the ice stops melting and the water has dropped to 32 degrees.Add meat. Submerge meat.  Cover.  (I usually use a cooler the size of the cut of meat/animal, and just add ice periodically.  As long as there is still ice, the water is still 32 degrees, and you're keeping the meat safe)After 24-36 hours, drain brine.  dab meat dry with paper towel. Cover meat with Hardware Store rub - I used to try and make my own rubs - but hardware local hardware store BBQ sections have the best.Set smoker temp to 200 - put meat in smoke - cook until 165.  If chicken or turkey - youre done.  If beef or pork, wrap it with foil - double wrap or more is ok.  Seal in the moisture that is still in the meat.
Increase heat to 250, and bring the meat up to 190 degrees.It works every time.
