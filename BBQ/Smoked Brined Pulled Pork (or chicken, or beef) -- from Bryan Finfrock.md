# Smoked Brined Pulled Pork (or chicken, or beef)
*From Bryan Finfrock*

This recipe works for pork, chicken, or beef. The brine keeps the meat incredibly moist and flavorful, while the low-and-slow smoking method ensures perfectly tender results every time.

## Ingredients

### For the Brine:
- 4 cups water
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- Lots of garlic (seriously - use plenty!)
- Fresh herbs (sage, thyme, and oregano work great with pork)
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar with "mother" (or red wine vinegar for beef)
- 4 cups ice

### For Smoking:
- Your choice of meat (pork shoulder, chicken, or beef)
- Hardware store BBQ rub (or your favorite dry rub)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Brine:
1. **Make brine**: Boil water with salt, garlic, and herbs until salt dissolves completely.

2. **Cool the brine**: Add 4 cups of ice to cool the mixture. Keep adding ice until it stops melting and the water temperature drops to 32°F.

3. **Brine the meat**: Submerge meat completely in the brine. Cover and refrigerate (or use a cooler with ice) for 24-36 hours, maintaining 32°F temperature.

### Prepare for Smoking:
4. **Prep the meat**: Remove from brine and pat dry with paper towels.

5. **Season**: Cover meat generously with your favorite BBQ rub.

### Smoking Process:
6. **Initial smoke**: Set smoker to 200°F. Smoke until internal temperature reaches 165°F.
   - **For chicken or turkey**: You're done! Rest and serve.
   - **For pork or beef**: Continue to next step.

7. **Wrap and finish**: Double-wrap meat tightly in foil to seal in moisture.

8. **Final cook**: Increase smoker temperature to 250°F. Continue cooking until internal temperature reaches 190°F.

9. **Rest**: Let meat rest for 15-30 minutes before shredding or slicing.

## Notes

- Use a cooler-sized container for brining larger cuts
- Maintain brine temperature by adding ice periodically
- Apple cider vinegar with "mother" helps break down the meat fibers
- This method works every time for perfectly moist, tender results
- Total cooking time varies by size, but expect 1-1.5 hours per pound
