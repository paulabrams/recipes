# Chimichurri

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 shallot, finely chopped
- [ ] 1 Fresno chile or red jalapeño, finely chopped
- [ ] 3–4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced or finely chopped
- [ ] ½ cup red wine vinegar
- [ ] 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
- [ ] ½ cup finely chopped fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems)
- [ ] ¼ cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (leaves and tender stems)
- [ ] 2 Tbsp. finely chopped fresh oregano leaves
- [ ] ¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil

## Directions

### 1. Prepare the Base

1. Combine shallot, chile, garlic, vinegar, and salt in a medium bowl
2. Let sit for 10 minutes to soften the aromatics and tame their raw sting

### 2. Add Herbs and Oil

1. Stir in cilantro, parsley, and oregano
2. Using a fork, whisk in olive oil
3. Transfer ½ cup chimichurri to a small bowl and season with additional salt if needed

### 3. Use as Marinade (Optional)

1. If using as a marinade, place beef, chicken, or pork in a glass, stainless-steel, or ceramic dish
2. Toss with remaining chimichurri
3. Cover and chill at least 3 hours or up to overnight
4. Remove meat from marinade, pat dry, and grill
5. Spoon reserved chimichurri over grilled meat

## Tips

- Fresh herbs are key - use the freshest parsley, oregano, and cilantro available
- Hand chopping gives better texture than using a food processor
- Let it sit - allowing the aromatics to sit with vinegar for 10 minutes softens them and tames their raw sting
- Best served fresh but will keep in refrigerator for a few days

## Notes

- Total time: 15 minutes
- Makes about 2 cups
- Can be assembled up to 3 days in advance
- Perfect as a sauce, marinade, or salad dressing
