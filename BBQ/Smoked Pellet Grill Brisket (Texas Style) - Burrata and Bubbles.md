# Smoked Pellet Grill Brisket (Texas Style)

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 (12-16 pound) whole packer brisket
- [ ] 1/4 cup salt
- [ ] 1/4 cup black pepper

## Directions
1. Remove brisket from refrigerator and trim fat cap to 1/4-inch thick. Trim gray edges. Flip over and remove excess fat patches and silver skin. Remove hard fat mass near point cut.
2. Mix salt and pepper. Sprinkle all over surface of meat and fat cap, including sides. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
3. Prepare smoker to 225°F. Add water pan and place brisket fat-side up directly on grates with point cut closest to heat source. Insert leave-in thermometer in thickest part of flat cut.
4. Smoke until internal temperature reaches about 160°F (when temperature stalls). Remove and wrap tightly in peach butcher paper.
5. Return to smoker and cook until internal temperature reaches 200-205°F (203°F is ideal).
6. Remove from smoker. Create small vent in butcher paper and rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours.
7. Slice across the grain, noting that different cuts have grains running in different directions.

- Don't overtrim fat cap - keep about 1/4 inch
