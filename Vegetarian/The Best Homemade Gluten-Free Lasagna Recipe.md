### Assembly:
- 12 gluten-free lasagna noodles (no-boil variety)

## Instructions

1. **Make the meat sauce**: In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.

2. **Add sauce ingredients**: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, nutmeg, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.

3. **Simmer**: Cover and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (Can be shortened to 20 minutes if needed, but longer is better for flavor development.)

4. **Prepare cheese mixture**: In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

5. **Preheat oven**: Set to 375°F (190°C).

6. **Assemble lasagna**: 
   - Spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish
   - Arrange gluten-free lasagna noodles lengthwise over meat sauce (no need to boil first!)
   - Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture
   - Top with 1/3 of mozzarella cheese slices
   - Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella
   - Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
   - Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese

7. **Bake**: Cover with foil (spray foil with cooking spray to prevent sticking). Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 25 minutes.

8. **Rest**: Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
