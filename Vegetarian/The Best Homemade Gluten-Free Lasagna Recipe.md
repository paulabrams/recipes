The Best Homemade Gluten-Free Lasagna Recipe
I needed enough to feed a crowd, so I tried this recipe. They didn't even know it was gluten free!

My sister and her three kids were coming over to the house, and I was trying to figure out what I could feed such a group of people. Then I remembered I owed my husband lasagna (from way before I even started the gluten-free diet), so I thought I would try it out.
I have to admit on this exact lasagna, I did not let everything simmer for as long as I should since I did not have a lot of time after work and the kids (and my hubby) were pretty hungry. I usually believe in the Julia Child method of letting things cook for awhile so all the flavors meld together.
Also, if you would like the non-gluten free version of this recipe, just use regular lasagna noodles rather than the gluten-free version. I served this to 5 people who are not on the gluten-free diet and they loved it!  No one knew it was gluten free till I told them. :)

Here are the directions to this great lasagna:
**Ingredients:**

1 lb. sweet Italian sausage

3/4 lb. lean ground beef

1/2 cup minced onion

4 cloves garlic, crushed

1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes

2 6-oz. cans tomato paste

2 6.5-oz. cans tomato sauce

1/2 cup water

2 tbsp. white sugar

1 1/2 tsp. dried basil leaves

1/2 tsp. fennel seeds

1 tsp.  nutmeg

1 tsp. Italian seasoning

1 Tbsp. salt

1/4 tsp. ground black pepper

4 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

16 oz. ricotta cheese

1 egg

1/2 tsp. salt

12 gluten-free lasagna noodles

3/4 lb. mozzarella cheese, slice

3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1.  In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
2.  Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, nutmeg, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.
3.  Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (This is where I cheated and only let it simmer about 20 mins, you can get away with this, but if you have time, simmer for the entire time.)

4.  In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
5.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6.  To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange gluten-free lasagna noodles (I used De Boles, as this is what I found at the \[Chesterfield Dierbergs) lengthwise over meat sauce.  The best thing about the gluten-free lasagna noodles is you do not have to boil them in water first, they are ready to be baked! Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
7.  Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
8.  Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
9.  Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
