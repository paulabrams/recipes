# Slow-Cooked Cabbage Rolls

A hearty and comforting dish featuring tender cabbage leaves stuffed with a savory filling and slow-cooked to perfection.

## Ingredients

### For the Filling:
- 1 lb ground beef or turkey
- 1 cup cooked rice
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp paprika

### For the Cabbage:
- 1 large head of cabbage
- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the cabbage**: Bring a large pot of water to boil. Carefully remove 12 large outer leaves from the cabbage head. Blanch the leaves in boiling water for 2-3 minutes until tender. Drain and set aside to cool.

2. **Make the filling**: In a large bowl, combine ground meat, cooked rice, diced onion, garlic, beaten egg, salt, pepper, and paprika. Mix well.

3. **Assemble the rolls**: Place about 1/4 cup of filling in the center of each cabbage leaf. Fold the bottom edge over the filling, fold in the sides, and roll up tightly.

4. **Prepare the sauce**: In a bowl, mix together diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper.

5. **Slow cook**: Place cabbage rolls seam-side down in the slow cooker. Pour the sauce over the rolls. Cover and cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or HIGH for 3-4 hours.

6. **Serve**: Let rest for 5 minutes before serving. Spoon extra sauce over the rolls.

## Notes

- Can be made vegetarian by substituting the meat with a mixture of mushrooms, lentils, or additional vegetables
