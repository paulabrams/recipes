# Butterflied "Spatchcocked" Chile-Lime Rubbed Chicken

*Team Traeger Recipe*

Spatchcocking (butterflying) removes the backbone so the bird lies flat on the grill, allowing the whole chicken to cook quicker with a beautiful presentation. This recipe features South American flavors and spices perfect for the grill.

## Recipe Details

- **Prep Time**: 10 minutes plus 12-24 hours marinating
- **Cook Time**: 40-50 minutes  
- **Serves**: 4-6
- **Recommended Wood**: Hickory, Mesquite, or Oak pellets

## Ingredients

### Chile-Lime Rub:
- 3 tbsp chile powder (preferably New Mexico chile) or Hungarian paprika
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tsp freshly grated lime zest
- 3 tbsp fresh lime juice
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano (preferably Mexican)
- 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- Pinch of ground cinnamon

### For the Chicken:
- 1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 lbs)
- Fresh cilantro for serving (optional)
- Extra lime juice for serving (optional)
- Salsa for serving (optional)

## Instructions

### Butterfly the Chicken:

1. **Position chicken**: Place whole chicken breast-side down on cutting board.

2. **Remove backbone**: Using sturdy kitchen shears, cut down one side of the backbone through the ribs. Make an identical cut on the opposite side to remove backbone completely. Discard or save for stock.

3. **Flatten**: Turn chicken cut-side down and flatten with heel of your hand to break the breastbone. For completely flat bird, you can also remove the keel bone (optional).

### Prepare and Marinate:

4. **Make rub**: Combine chile powder and oil in a small bowl with lime zest, lime juice, garlic, coriander, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper, and cinnamon to form a wet paste.

5. **Apply rub**: Generously smear spice rub under and over the skin and on the interior of the bird.

6. **Marinate**: Place in nonreactive baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours.

### Grill the Chicken:

7. **Preheat grill**: Start Traeger on Smoke with lid open until fire is established (4-5 minutes). Preheat to 400°F with lid closed for 10-15 minutes.

8. **Cook**: Place butterflied chicken breastbone-side down on grill grate. Cook for 40-50 minutes or until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part (without touching bone) registers 165°F.

9. **Rest and serve**: Transfer to platter and let rest 5-10 minutes before carving. Garnish with cilantro and squeeze of lime juice if desired.

## Notes

- Butterflying reduces cooking time significantly compared to whole roasted chicken
- The wet rub creates incredible flavor and helps prevent drying out
- Can be adapted for oven cooking at 425°F
- Great served with Mexican sides like rice, beans, or tortillas
