# Shawarma Roast Chicken With Shallots and Lemons

*By Andy Baraghani - Bon Appétit*

Yogurt acts as both a tenderizer and flavor carrier for the aromatic shawarma spices in this recipe. The chicken marinates for just 30 minutes (or up to 12 hours), making it exceedingly doable without tons of planning. Roasting alongside shallots and lemons creates jammy, crispy accompaniments cooked in rich chicken juices.

## Ingredients

*Serves 4*

### Spice Mixture:
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 1/2 tsp black peppercorns
- 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 3/4 tsp ground turmeric

### For the Chicken:
- 4 garlic cloves, finely grated
- 1/4 cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt or sour cream
- 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 whole chicken (3 1/2-4 lbs), patted dry
- Kosher salt
- 3 medium shallots, halved lengthwise
- 1 lemon, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds, seeds removed
- 4 oregano or thyme sprigs, plus leaves for serving
- Flaky sea salt (for serving)

## Special Equipment

- Spice mill or coffee grinder
- Large oven-safe skillet
- Instant-read thermometer

## Instructions

1. **Make spice mixture**: Finely grind coriander seeds, cumin seeds, peppercorns, paprika, and turmeric in a spice mill. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk in garlic, yogurt, and 2 tbsp oil.

2. **Marinate chicken**: Generously season chicken with salt, then smear yogurt mixture all over. Let sit on a rimmed baking sheet at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or chill uncovered up to 12 hours. If chilling, let chicken sit at room temperature 30 minutes before roasting.

3. **Start cooking**: Preheat oven to 425°F. Heat remaining 2 tbsp oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken breast-side up in pan, then nestle shallots cut-side down and lemon slices around chicken. Season shallots and lemon with salt. Tuck in oregano sprigs and cook undisturbed until shallots start to brown, about 3 minutes.

4. **Roast**: Pour 1/2 cup water into pan and transfer skillet to oven, arranging so legs point toward back of oven. Roast until skin takes on color, 10-15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325°F and continue roasting until chicken is cooked through (instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast should register 155°F; it will climb to 165°F as chicken rests) and shallots are jammy, 60-70 minutes.

5. **Rest and serve**: Let rest 15 minutes. Transfer chicken to cutting board and carve as desired. Arrange on platter with shallots and lemon slices. Spoon pan juices over chicken, top with oregano leaves, and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

## Notes

- The yogurt marinade creates both tender meat and a beautiful crust
- Can marinate for as little as 30 minutes or up to 12 hours
- Total cooking time is about 75-85 minutes
- Internal temperature should reach 165°F for food safety
