I swear to you that I haven’t died, nor have I fallen off the face of the earth. You see, Friends, we’re a month into the new school year, and when we’re not home being studious, we’re driving all over Northern Michigan for soccer games.

_Like, literally_. Five days a week.

Son #1 is playing on two teams, Son #3 is playing on a team in which my BFF Becky and I are coaching, and Sons #2 & #4 are doing their best to conquer every field-side playground in the region.

L to R: the sweeper “The Wall”, defenseman Son #1, and the keeper “Sticky Fingers.”

In short, it’s been crazy up in the Comfortably Domestic house, but we’re loving every minute of it. Of course, all this cray-cray activity leaves me with little energy to cook. In fact, I’m not too proud to say that I’m passed out on the couch the minute I sit down for the (usually) first time all evening. Yep…I’m a barrel of laughs come sundown.

However, \[with a little planning, we are managing to eat fairly well in the midst of the chaos. Read: I’m not caving in to Carry Out  Muse that whispers promises of ready-to-eat comfort food into my ear each night. If there’s one thing that I’ve learned about myself, it’s that when I’m bone-tired and craving comfort food, it helps to have a few quick dinners that taste better than take-out in my arsenal, so as not to succumb to the lure of the drive through window.

I have a big backlog of dinners to share, so I thought I’d start out with my favorite meal of the past month–a nut-free version of my favorite Thai take out, chicken satay. Normally, chicken satay is served covered in a peanut butter sauce, but since peanuts are not welcome in our house, I used \[my favorite sunflower seed butter instead.

We love it so much that it’s earned a top spot in our regular dinner rotation! Nut-Free Thai Chicken Satay is tender, marinated chicken, stir fried to perfection and then served on a bed of fluffy coconut rice–all before being drizzled with the creamy sunflower butter sauce.  The layers of flavor in this dish are truly wonderful!

Now, if peanuts don’t close airways in your house, then by all means, go ahead and substitute peanut butter in the sauce. Just know that I don’t think I’m being biased when I say that the Creamy SunButter really makes the dish.

Nut-Free Chicken Satay is sure to satisfy cravings for carry out, even in the midst of even the busiest of weeks.

**Important Note:** *This recipe requires a lot of simultaneous prep work and cooking in order to have each component of the meal finish at the same time. I’ll explain each step as best I can individually, but please keep in mind that you’ll be cooking the chicken, rice, and sauce at the same time. I find it helpful to read the directions in their entirety before proceeding.*

Place one chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap, and pound them to and even ½-inch thickness with the flat side of a meat mallet. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Slice the flattened chicken against the grain, into ½-inch slices. Set the chicken aside while you whip up the marinade.

Whisk the brown sugar, minced garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, orange juice, soy sauce, and water together in a large bowl to combine. Submerge the sliced chicken in the marinade in the bowl, turning to coat evenly. Refrigerate the chicken for one hour or longer. To be honest, I usually toss the chicken in the marinade in the morning, and let it hang out an soak up the wonderful all day long.

While the chicken marinades, prepare the star of the show–the sauce! For the sauce, whisk together the SunButter, sugar, water, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and freshly squeezed orange juice in a small saucepan until smooth. Place a lid on the pan and set it aside for a few minutes, so you can start the rice. Timing is everything!

Pour the coconut milk into a medium saucepan, along with the water, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then add the rice. Stir the rice, place a well-fitting lid on the pan, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer the rice for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the rice has fully absorbed the liquid. Remove the coconut rice from heat and leave it covered until dinner is ready to be served.

As the rice rice is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat until it ripples and shimmers from the heat. Drain and discard the marinade from the chicken. Place the chicken in the hot pan, being careful not to get splattered with hot oil. Spread the chicken in an even layer in the pan with a pair of tongs. Stir fry the chicken, flipping frequently, until chicken is cooked through, and slightly caramelized on the outside. (About 15-20 minutes.) Remove the chicken from heat.

While the chicken is cooking, warm the sauce over low heat until heated through.

Fluff the rice with fork before spooning a bed of rice onto each plate. Lay the chicken upon the bed of rice, and drizzle the SunButter sauce over top. Finish the dish with a sprinkling of roasted, lightly salted sunflower seed kernels, thinly sliced shallots, and a sprinkling of chopped parsley, if desired.
