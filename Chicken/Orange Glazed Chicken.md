## Directions

### For the Chicken
1. In a small bowl, mix orange zest, 2 tablespoons rosemary, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper
2. Place chicken in a ziplock bag and rub marinade into chicken thoroughly
3. Refrigerate for 2 hours, turning bag occasionally
4. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450°F
5. Place chicken on rimmed baking sheet skin side up
6. Roast until skin is deep golden and chicken reaches 175°F internal temperature, about 20 minutes
7. While chicken roasts, make glaze: bring orange juice to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat
8. Reduce orange juice to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes
9. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary, apricot preserves, and 1/4 teaspoon salt
10. Cook until syrupy and reduced to about 1/3 cup
11. When chicken is cooked, brush glaze over chicken
12. Increase oven to broil and cook just until glaze browns, 1-2 minutes
13. Transfer to serving plate and let rest 15 minutes before serving

### For the Spinach Salad
1. In medium bowl, whisk vinegar, mustard, and salt
2. Slowly whisk in olive oil until combined
3. Toss spinach with dressing, blue cheese, walnuts, and orange segments
4. Season to taste with salt and pepper
5. Serve immediately with the chicken

## Tips
