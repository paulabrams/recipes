3. Boil spinach and mint in same pot until wilted, 5-10 seconds. Transfer to bowl with peas. Reserve 1/2 cup ice water.
4. Drain pea mixture well. Purée in a blender, adding reserved ice water by tablespoonfuls if mixture is too thick. Add oil and sugar; purée. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.

### Assembly
5. Prepare a grill to medium-high heat. Cut flesh from peel of preserved lemon (if using fresh lemon, use a vegetable peeler to remove yellow part of peel). Thinly slice peel.
6. Put shallot, vinegar, and pinch of salt in a small bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Add peel, 1/3 cup oil, parsley, and honey; whisk to blend. Season lemon salsa with salt and pepper.
7. Season fish with salt and pepper. Brush grill rack with oil. Grill fish until just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.

9. Divide pea mixture among plates. Top with fish and spoon lemon salsa over.
