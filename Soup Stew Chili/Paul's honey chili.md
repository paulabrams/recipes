# Paul's Honey Chili

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb ground beef OR 1 lb hot Italian pork sausages (or use both and double recipe)
- [ ] 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
- [ ] 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- [ ] 4 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 bag kidney beans, pre-soaked and/or pre-boiled with first water drained
- [ ] 3 jars diced tomatoes (jovial brand preferred)
- [ ] ½ teaspoon black pepper
- [ ] ½ teaspoon various chili flakes (to vary the taste)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1 teaspoon cumin
- [ ] 1 teaspoon coriander
- [ ] 1 teaspoon chili powder
- [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh or dried garden herbs (especially thyme and oregano)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Thai basil and Vietnamese coriander (optional)
- [ ] 2 small spicy whole chili (e.g. black cobra, arbol, thai, etc.) (optional)

## Directions
1. Heat a cast iron pot and add oil (possibly the fat from the top of pulled pork sauce).
2. Brown the meat, onion, peppers, and garlic in the pot.
3. In the same pot, add the tomatoes, beans, and all seasonings.
4. Simmer for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Fish out any whole chilis you added, so someone can enjoy them intentionally.
6. If it's too spicy: add a little lemon juice, honey, and/or wine; skim off the oil on the top (and reserve for a treat).

## Tips
- Uses leftover sauce from pulled pork, which has a lot of honey and paprika
- Can double the recipe for larger groups
- Adjust spice level with chili flakes and whole peppers

## Notes
- Serves 4-6 people
- Great use for leftover pulled pork sauce
- Can be made milder by reducing chili ingredients
