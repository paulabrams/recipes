- [ ] 1/4 cup packed (55 g) organic brown sugar

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and line a loaf pan with parchment paper or spray with nonstick spray.
2. Mash banana in a large bowl. Add vanilla, egg, oil, sugars, honey, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and almond milk. Whisk vigorously to combine.
3. Add almond meal, gluten-free flour blend, and oats. Stir until just combined.
4. Pour into prepared loaf pan.
5. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. When ready, it should feel firm and be crackly and golden brown on top.
