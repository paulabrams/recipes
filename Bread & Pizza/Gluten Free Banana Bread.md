# Gluten Free Banana Bread

## Ingredients

- 3 medium very over-ripe bananas (brown is good!)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/3 cup pure [maple syrup](https://rstyle.me/+caPzUZmyEKYbpQo6IeAhZA)
- 1/4 cup oil (I used avocado oil)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups packed [almond flour](https://rstyle.me/+InUKeUN6NHfJh-FI-MtLGQ) (163g)
- 1 1/4 cups certified GF [oat flour](https://rstyle.me/+Uo-LzzKc9JNIk1BbZkdN2g)* (124g)
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips, plus more for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a [loaf pan](https://rstyle.me/+rj0Vg3bYDhKqgSM5GQNHUQ) with cooking spray.
2. Place bananas in a large [mixing bowl](https://rstyle.me/+lX-Ucak4oV2_QhWyzWLu0g). Mash well with a fork or potato masher. Add eggs, maple syrup, oil and vanilla and whisk until very well combined.
3. Add almond flour (make sure it's really packed in there), oat flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Use a wooden spoon to mix just until incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips.
4. Pour mixture into loaf pan and top with additional chocolate chips. Bake for about 60 minutes, or until a knife comes out almost clean. I like to cover the bread loosely with foil around 40 minutes to avoid the top getting too brown. Allow bread to cool in pan for at least 30 minutes before carefully removing it and transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
